  paragraphTitle: What I did
  paragraphText: |
    The core UI of the app was written in React Native. The AR model loading
    and rendering was in Unity3D. There was a need for a layer that glues these technologies.
    I wrote the methods used for communication between 3 layers of the app.
    1. React Native
    2. Native iOS code
    3. Unity3D

    This is a clone of the open source Signal Messenger.
    I deployed to a custom server the backend and
    many other infrastructure elements required for the messenger to work.
    The client needed an safe internal messenger for a small firm.
    The app has custom Firebise backend for user management.
    Admin can create/update/delete users instead of using SMS service as in the
    original Signal.
