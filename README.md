# Yesbol Kulanbekov's Home Page

This is the code for the [Yesbol Kulanbekov Home Page](https://www.yesbolkulanekov.github.io).

<!-- ![Yesbol Kulanbekov Home Page Screenshot](/assets/img/screenshots/ykulanbekov-homepage-screenshot.png) -->

I wanted a clean, simple home page where I could put my portfolio, resume and
projects. This repository is a clone of https://github.com/brikis98/yevgeniy-brikman-homepage.git
My home page was built based on [Yevgeniy Brikman Home Page](https://www.ybrikman.com).
