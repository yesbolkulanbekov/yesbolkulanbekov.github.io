Call of Duty 4 is one of the most exciting single player adventures in years. 
If only it was a bit longer... 

\+ Terrific graphics and presentation  
\+ Awesome sound  
\+ Amazing variety in gameplay  
\+ Incredibly tight pacing and scripting  
\+ Great set pieces  
\+ Tons of attention to detail  
\- Really, really short singleplayer  

## Introduction

{% include figure.html path="blog/thumbs/call-of-duty-4.png" alt="Call of Duty 4" %}

For the last year or so, I have found myself extremely underwhelmed by just 
about all the games I had tried. Even the "best of breed" - games that got 
rave reviews from virtually everyone - weren't doing it for me. 
[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl](http://www.stalker-game.com/), for 
example, got boring just 15 minutes in. [Halo 3](http://www.halo3.com/) - my 
first experience with the Halo series - was so absurdly unimpressive, I began 
to question the sanity of Xbox owners. 
[BioShock](http://www.2kgames.com/bioshock/), despite my recent interest in 
[Ayn Rand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand) novels, held my attention 
for no more than a few levels. During a particularly boring spell, I actually 
did play [Quake 4](http://www.idsoftware.com/games/quake/quake4/) all the way 
through, but was left with a stale taste in my mouth. The game had brief 
glimmers of cool ideas &amp; plot twists, but didn't develop any of them, and 
ended up feeling just like the original 
[Quake](http://www.idsoftware.com/games/quake/quake/), which I beat during 
another dry spell years ago. The list of disappointments goes on and on. 

Only two explanations came to mind: either I had outgrown video games or I had 
ADD. I actually wasn't sure which would be worse. [Call of Duty 4: Modern 
Warfare](http://www.callofduty.com/) blew both of these excuses out of the 
water. The game is phenomenal and a testament to the fact that strong game 
design can impress even the most jaded gamer. 

Let's break it down.

## Graphics: 9.0/10 

If you've got the horsepower to run it, this is one beautiful game. Great 
lighting effects, awesome particle effects (smoke, sparks, explosions), 
terrific use of blur, good player models, and high resolution textures really 
make this game worth looking at. The graphics engine is very well rounded, 
doing a terrific job with a wide variety of environments - day, night, middle 
eastern streets, central Europe in winter, ocean liner, office buildings, etc. 
Technologically speaking, some graphics engines out there might top CoD 4 in 
certain areas, but there's really nothing to complain about here. 

## Artistic Design: 10/10 

The game is full of meticulous detail that really make it a pleasure to look 
at and play. It's really the little things that make it shine: the awesome 
tall grass &amp; camouflage that actually allows you to hide; the subtle blur 
effect when looking down the site of a gun; the ability to shoot through 
certain materials (wood, sheet metal, etc); the realistic death animations; 
the way soldiers hold their guns as they enter a room; the heat coming off the 
barrel of a gun after firing; the lighting fast transitions from briefing to 
combat. And the list goes on and on. Quite simply, it's a pleasure to see the 
game in action. 

## Sound: 10/10 

The sounds in this game are a huge part of what makes it so immersive. Every 
time a gun fight breaks out, it really sounds like a war zone. All around you, 
cars are exploding, pipes are bursting, glass is shattering, and RPGs are 
flying. Guns sound (and are) powerful, bad guys are constantly shouting in 
their native languages, and bullets will be wizzing by you non stop. The music 
is a perfect fit and the voice acting is top notch. 

## Plot: 7.5/10 

The single-player game is story driven, but for the most part, it's a very 
generic tale of terrorism, war and nuclear weapons. 

## Level Design: 10/10 

While the story itself is fairly forgettable, it does provide the setting for 
some incredibly memorable and exciting levels. The game is filled with "oh 
sh*t" moments that you'll be dying to show your friends. From the very first 
level (the one after the training), the game pulls you in and won't let go. 
It's very fast paced and tightly scripted, and is best described as being part 
of an incredible action movie. 

## Gameplay: 9/10 

At the core, CoD4 is a first person shooter, so most of the mechanics are 
familiar. However, given the game's length (see below), there is a huge 
variety of missions. You'll do close quarters battle aboard a ship, go through 
an incredible stealth sequence as a sniper, man the guns of an AC-130, battle 
through the war-torn streets of a middle-eastern town and more. There are tons 
of effective weapons at your disposal and the combat tends to be fairly 
realistic. For example, even though there isn't an "official" duck &amp; cover 
system (as in [Gears of War](http://gearsofwar.com/)), you'll often find that 
if you don't find cover, you'll be shot to pieces in seconds. 

The damage/health model is a bit different than most shooters: there is no 
health or shields explicitly visible. Instead, your character automatically 
heals, as long as you don't take too much damage at any one time. For example, 
if a stray bullet hits you, it does some damage, but you recover fairly 
quickly. However, if you take a spray of AK47 fire from close range, you're 
likely dead. The main advantage of this system is that you don't have to waste 
time hording health packs or medkits, which allows for a more continuous game 
experience. The disadvantage is that there is relatively little penalty for 
getting shot, so long as you're not shot too badly. Overall, I think the pros 
outweigh the cons, as it allows for a faster and smoother gameplay experience. 

## Length: 5/10 

The single player campaign is short. Really really short. The first 
play-through for an experienced gamer would probably take no more than 4 
hours. There is a little replay value in trying some levels on harder 
difficulty levels, or in "arcade mode", but the length is truly disappointing. 
Having said that, it's worth noting that just about every second of those 4 
hours is a blast. The game never lets up, going from set piece to 
heart-pumping set piece, not wasting any time on repetitive gameplay. 

## Stability/Bugs: 10/10 

I did not encounter a single bug or crash while playing CoD4. 

## Performance: 10/10 

The game ran beautifully with max settings at 1680x1050 on my computer: 

* AMD X2 3800+ 
* 2GB RAM 
* ATI x1900xtx 
* WinXP SP2 

## Overall: 9.5/10 (Not an average) 

This is one of the most thrilling games I've played in a while. Other than the 
length, this game does just about everything right. 

## Additional Notes

I have not tried (nor reviewed) the multiplayer component of CoD4.
