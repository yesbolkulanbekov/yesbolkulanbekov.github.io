For the first several months of Crossfit, I simply followed the workouts laid 
out on the [Crossfit mainsite](http://www.crossfit.com/). After that, noticing 
slow progress on my squat &amp; deadlift, I did a MEBB style routine for a few 
months. This included two days a week dedicated towards pure strength/power 
workouts and three days a week towards purely metcon. Although the MEBB 
routine worked pretty well, I felt that a more integrated approach would be 
even more effective. Inspired by the [Gant Grimes Hybrid 
Program](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=111530641), the 
recently released [Crossfit Strength 
Bias](http://journal.crossfit.com/2009/02/crossfit-strength-bias.tpl) (CFSB) 
article and the [Crossfit Football](http://www.crossfitfootball.com/) website, 
I present my **Crossfit Strength/Power Hybrid**. As the name implies, the goal 
is to tweak the standard Crossfit routine towards producing more strength 
&amp; power without sacrificing any metcon abilities. This routine is *heavily 
*based on the aforementioned sources (ie, this is nothing new) and is very 
much in an experimental stage, but I felt that laying it out in this official 
manner would be a good way to organize myself. 

## The Routine

Each day consists of three components: a strength/power exercise, a metcon, 
and some skill work. 

### Sunday 

* Deadlift (1x5 or 1x3) 
* Metcon (20 min max) 
* Planche (tuck, 1 min total hold) 

### Monday 

Rest day 

### Tuesday 

* Snatch (5x3 or 7x2 or 7x1) 
* Metcon (20 min max) 
* Pistols (3x5, each leg) 

### Wednesday 

* Squats (1x20) and OH Press (3x5 or 5x3 or 3x3) 
* Metcon (10 min max) 
* Front or Back Lever (1 min total hold) 

### Thursday 

* Clean (5x3 or 7x2 or 7x1) 
* Metcon (20 min max) 
* L-sit (1 min total hold) 

### Friday 

Rest day 

### Saturday 

* Squat (3x5 or 5x3 or 3x3) and Bench Press (3x5 or 5x3 or 3x3) 
* Metcon (10 min max) 
* Handstand (1 min total hold) 

## Notes 

Each workout includes three main components (strength/power, metcon and skill) 
plus a warm-up (dynamic stretches) and a cool down (static stretches). The 
warm-up, cool down and skill work should take 10 minutes each. The 
strength/power and metcon components should generally take less than 20 
minutes each, plus a 10 minute break in between. That adds up to 80 minutes 
total. If workouts are taking longer than this, something is wrong. 

Strength/power workouts should typically use ascending sets instead of sets 
across. The goal is to hit a new PR (1RM, 2RM, 3RM, 5RM or 20RM) on the final 
set of each exercise each week. It's also a good idea to zig-zag rep schemes 
when you stall. For example, if you were doing a 3x5 on squats and got stuck, 
switch to a 5x3. When you get stuck again, try a 3x3. When you get stuck once 
more, go back to 3x5 and start the cycle all over again. Also, when doing 
strength/power workouts, it's ok to do variations or similar exercises 
instead. For example, the power snatch and OH squat can be done instead of the 
full snatch and the power clean or clean &amp; jerk can be done instead of the 
clean. The only exception to the zig zag rule and substitution rule is 
Wednesday's workout: [20 rep 
squats](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/cyberpump24.htm). These should always 
be done just as written: a single work set of 20 reps of back squats. I'd 
suggest starting with a light weight the first week (not your 10RM as is 
sometimes recommended) and adding 5-10lbs every week after that. It'll get 
nightmarishly hard pretty quickly, but the benefits are huge. 

Metcons should be kept short, always under ~20 minutes. A *slightly* longer 
workout once a week (especially right before a rest day) is ok. Although the 
[Crossfit mainsite](http://www.crossfit.com/) should still be the primary 
source of metcons, make frequent use of workouts from [Crossfit 
Football](http://www.crossfitfootball.com/) and the [Hybrid Program Heavy 
Metcons](http://board.crossfit.com/showthread.php?t=35062) thread as they are 
typically shorter &amp; heavier. Crossfit Football is especially useful as 
their workouts frequently include sprinting, something mainsite Crossfit oddly 
lacks. 

The skill portion is primarily there to develop whatever skills you are weak 
in. In my case, these are primarily gymnastics moves, but almost anything you 
struggle with is fair game: double-unders, POSE technique, muscle-ups, extra 
o-lift practice, etc. If the skill work is actually holding back your fitness 
(ie, preventing you from doing workouts), you will want to move it *before* 
the metcon so you are fresh when doing it. For me, the gymnastics work is just 
for fun and non-essential, so I place it at the end. 

## Some Words on Recovery 

The biggest challenge with this routine will be recovery. Doing so much heavy 
lifting on top of normal Crossfit workouts will seriously tax your body and 
push your CNS to its limits. That's why the routine uses ascending sets (to 
keep volume low), is 5 days a week (rather than 3 on, 1 off), and why metcons 
need to be kept short. Moreover, getting sufficient sleep (8 hours minimum per 
night) and eating a good diet (*plenty* of calories and protein) are 
essential. Despite all that, if you are really pushing yourself, you are still 
likely to slowly see [overtraining 
symptoms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtraining). To deal with these, I'd 
suggest the following for reducing workout volume: 

1. If you're really fried after a metcon, it's ok to skip the skill work: 
when you're that tired, you probably won't get much out of it anyway. 
1. In general, I've found that the o-lifts (snatch, clean) and upper body 
power lifts (OH and bench press) don't impact my recovery too much. However, 
squats and especially deadlifts almost always do. Skipping 20 rep squats one 
week or deadlifts another week can go a surprisingly long way to helping you 
recover. 
1. Every 3-4 weeks, skip an entire workout and every 8-12 weeks, skip 2-3 
workouts in a row. With a routine of this sort, you're often working right at 
the edge of overtraining, so when you come back from this extra rest, you'll 
often find yourself a whole lot stronger. 

## My Results Thus Far 

Since starting this Strenth/Power hybrid in April (~4 months), I've seen the 
following improvements: 

1. Deadlift (5rm): +40lbs 
1. Squat (5rm): +30lbs 
1. Squat (20rm): +60lbs 
1. OH Press (3rm): +15lbs 
1. Bench Press (3rm): +10lbs 
1. Clean (1rm): +20lbs 
1. Snatch (1rm): +30lbs 

I also set PR's on *every* metcon workout that was a repeat, including Fran, 
Barbara, 800m run, 1 mile run, 5k run, Tabata Something Else, Elizabeth, 
Helen, FGB, Murph, Michael, Cindy and many others. Overall, I'm pretty happy 
with the results. If I can keep this up, I'll hopefully be checking off many 
of my [2009 goals](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2009/04/17/my-2009-goals/) 
real soon.
