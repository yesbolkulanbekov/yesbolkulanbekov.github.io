I do a lot of things the majority of people really don't understand. For 
example, software engineering. The average person just doesn't know what it 
is, often confusing it with IT. If your first thought was "what's the 
difference?" or "what's IT?", then you are one of those people. You are 
probably that jerk that, upon learning what I do for a living, immediately 
asks me to fix your printer or make your "Internet" work. But software 
engineering is not IT.  I do NOT sit around all day cleaning viruses off your 
computer and making your email work. I *create *software. If computers were 
like books, software engineers would be the authors and IT would be the guys 
that fix the printing press if it malfunctions. 

But I didn't want to talk about software engineering today. Instead, I wanted 
to discuss another misunderstood hobby of mine: weight lifting (aka strength 
training, resistance training, "going to the gym", "pumping iron", etc). I've 
been lifting consistently for about 4 years now and my current routine is to 
workout 3 day a week, 1.5 hours a day. Many people seem to have the impression 
that I spend all 90 minutes standing in front of a mirror doing bicep curls 
and grunting. It's as if arms are the only parts of your body that get 
stronger. My mom has a wonderful habit of pulling up my shirt sleeve in front 
of her friends and asking me to flex as she makes weird grunt noises on my 
behalf. 

The reality is that when it comes to strength training, my biceps could hardly 
concern me less. During the average week, I do at most 2 sets of bicep curls, 
amounting to 10 reps, or all of 2 minutes of grunting a week. So what the hell 
do I do the rest of the time? 

Before I get to that, it's worth answering the following questions: 

## What is strength? 

In the most basic sense, strength is a measurement of how much force your body 
can exert in a particular motion. It's worth noting that strength is made up 
of many components: muscle size, muscular endurance, tendon/ligament strength, 
skeletal strength, coordination, and much more. 

## What is strength training? 

Strength training is the use of various forms of resistance to increase 
strength. Please do NOT confuse strength training with "body building", where 
the goal is not strength, but a particular appearance. To illustrate the 
difference, compare [Arnold 
Schwarzenegger](http://www.moonbattery.com/archives/arnold-schwarzenegger.jpg) 
(world famous body builder) to [Andy 
Bolton](http://www.propeptide.com/gif/andy-bolton-01.jpg) (strongest man 
alive). Body building has made Arnold strong, but his primary goal was a 
statue-esque physique and enormous muscles. While Bolton is nowhere near as 
god-like in appearance, he is *significantly* stronger than Arnold - Bolton 
has deadlifted over 1000lbs and squatted over 1200lbs, both world records. 

## Why do strength training? 

To set the record straight, I am not trying to *look* like Andy Bolton (or 
Arnold, for that matter). But I do want to train like Andy Bolton, with the 
primary goal being strength. Here are a few reasons why: 

1. Increased muscular power and endurance: useful in sports (run faster, jump 
higher, etc) &amp; life situations (opening mayonnaise jars, carrying luggage, 
fighting off assholes). 
1. Increased muscle mass: boosts metabolism, allowing for better weight 
management. Yup, you'll actually lose more fat with proper strength training 
than pretending to use that dusty treadmill in your basement. 
1. Improved balance and coordination. 
1. Increased bone density. 
Injury prevention: stronger muscles, bones and tendons help protect the 
body. 
1. Better sleep: after a hard workout, your body needs to heal, and you 
sleep like a baby. 
1. Better looks. 
1. Better overall health and more energy through out the day. 
The list goes on and on. I don't want to turn this into an infomercial, but 
it's important to explain this stuff. Strength training is a lot more than big 
biceps. 

## So, if not bicep curls, what are you doing? 

The first thing to understand is that there are many approaches to strength 
training. Unfortunately, most of them don't work very well. Here are some easy 
ways to identify bad strength training routines: 

1. Anything your friends recommend to you is probably bad. 
1. Anything the gym trainer recommends to you is probably bad. 
1. Anything you found on the Internet is bad (including anything I write). 

I'm only half joking, actually. Exercise and weight loss are a big 
business and the amount of misinformation out there is ridiculous. Your 
friends are in no better position to know it than you and are completely 
untrained to give you advice. Unfortunately, most gym trainers are also very 
poorly versed in strength training. They are often only taught how to use the 
machines on the floor (which you should avoid for strength training) and like 
to spread stupid rumors, like "squatting is bad for your knees". 

Of course, as a beginner, you can can try almost anything and see results. 
Millions of years of evolution have allowed your body to react wonderfully to 
the shock of peeling your fat ass from the couch and picking up a dumbbell. 
However, after a very short time, crappy programs become less and less 
effective. It's not long before you see no progress at all and give up. 

The single greatest thing you can do is to follow routines created and 
endorsed by strength training experts. Not machines advertised at 3am on tv, 
not fad diets, and not books published by body builders. The difference 
between something you scrap together by yourself and a proper strength 
training routine cannot be overstated. Think of taking up strength training 
like being sued: you could go to court and make up a defense based on the 
advice of your friends and something you read online... But wouldn't you 
rather follow the advice of an expert? 

## Starting Strength 

The gold standard is [Starting 
Strength](http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-2nd-Mark-Rippetoe/dp/0976805421) 
by Mark Rippetoe and Lon Kilgore. This is **the** book, the weight lifting 
bible, and it should be required reading for ANYONE that sets foot in a gym. 
This book (make sure to get the 2nd edition) will teach you everything you 
need to know about proper strength training, including clearly written 
instructions on each exercise and excellent illustrations and photographs. It 
not only explains what to do, but also why, and the amount of research put 
into it is impressive. 

If you know me, you know I would never recommend spending money on something 
you could get for free, but the information in this book is NOT available 
elsewhere. Your friends don't know it, the gym trainers will get it all wrong, 
and the morons online will only lead you astray. No, I am not in any way 
affiliated with the authors/publishers and I don't profit in any way from 
writing this. But if you do any form of strength training whatsoever, this is 
a resource that you need to know about. 

And no, you don't have to do the Rippetoe Starting Strength routine itself. 
It's a fantastic routine, but there are other very effective alternatives 
available. However, they all focus on the same basic principles: 

1. Working *every* part of the body (this includes legs!!) several times a 
week. 
1. Repeat a relatively small number of exercises each time to become very 
proficient at them. 
1. The most effective exercises are compound movements - those that involve 
multiple muscle groups and joints. This is in direct contrast to what most 
people do at the gym, which are isolation movements that focus on just one 
muscle/joint at a time. The bicep curl is an isolation exercise and as such, 
largely ignored in effective strength training programs. 
1. Most exercises are done with barbells. 
1. Most exercises are done with high weight and low reps (sets of 5, 
typically). 
1. The main exercises are the squat, bench press, deadlift, overhead 
press, rows, clean &amp; jerk, pull-ups and dips. 
1. Most workouts are focused around the squat, as this is the best 
bang-for-the-buck exercise for total body development. It works something like 
65% (if not more) of the muscles in your body and produces a massive hormonal 
response. Translation: your biceps will get much bigger if you do squats + 
curls than just curls alone, even though the squat doesn't directly work your 
biceps. As an added advantage, the squat will also give you strong legs, back, 
hips, butt, abs, balance, and so on. 
1. The only differences between the various routines are exactly which 
exercises are done, for how many sets and for how many reps. As such, Starting 
Strength is a wonderful how-to guide for any of these routines. 

Some of the most effective routines are: 

1. Rippetoe Starting Strength (a partial writeup is available 
[here](http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=998224), but definitely 
buy the book!!) 
1. [Stronglifts 
5x5](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/): 
very similar to starting strength. 
1. [Bill Star 
5x5](http://www.geocities.com/elitemadcow1/5x5_Program/Linear_5x5.htm): a 
program focused on intermediate lifters 
1. [Crossfit](http://www.crossfit.com/): a program focused on not just 
strength, but also endurance, agility, coordination, power, etc. 

## Reservations 

When I try to convince people to start strength training, I get a lot of 
stupid responses: 

1. Oh, I've been meaning to go... but... (insert stupid excuse here) 
1. I don't have time 
1. I don't want to get "huge" 

Yes, almost any excuse you give is bound to be dumb. Just about everyone out 
there, young and old, male or female, healthy or not, will see serious 
benefits from strength training. You can argue with me till you're blue in the 
face, but try a proper strength training routine for 10 weeks - and actually 
stick with it for more than 2 days this time - and report back to me. If you 
didn't see *noticeable* results, you did something wrong. 

The time issue is a bunch of BS. Exercise is something you *make* time for. 
It's as important as making time for doctor's appointments, getting your car 
fixed and watching (insert your favorite show here). 

As for the "getting huge" issue, I need to warn you: it's kind of insulting to 
say that to someone who has been working out for a long time. Getting huge is 
NOT EASY. It doesn't just happen. You don't walk into a gym, pick up a 
dumbbell, and suddenly swell to Arnold proportions. It takes *years* of hard 
work, a very specific routine, and proper dieting to get "huge". The vast 
majority of people that do strength training - even those who are pretty damn 
strong - will never get particularly huge. Strength training is NOT body 
building and muscle size is not the goal. 

So when you nonchalantly use this excuse in front of someone who has spent 
hundreds of hours working their ass off at a gym, it's like a slap to the 
face. Either you're insulting them because they haven't gotten huge despite 
their efforts  - where as you, in your grand arrogance, would grow like mario 
on mushrooms just from signing up for a gym membership... Or you're directly 
telling them you don't want to look anything like them. Way to go. 

Moreover, if you are female, it's almost impossible for you to become huge 
without steroids or other extreme measures. There are dozens of articles 
online about this and suffice it to say that strength training will only make 
you look more attractive. Checkout some of the pictures of the women of 
[crossfit](http://www.crossfit.com/) (many of whom are incredibly strong) to 
see what I mean. 

## So, at last, my routine 

Well, I promised I'd tell you what I spend all my time doing, so at last, here 
it is: 

* Tuesday: bicep curls, 90 minutes 
* Thursday: bicep curls, 90 minutes 
* Saturday: bicep curls, 80 minutes followed by 10 minutes of flexing in front 
of the mirror. 

## OK, OK, my real routine 

For the last half a year, I've been doing the [Bill Star 
5x5](http://www.geocities.com/elitemadcow1/5x5_Program/Linear_5x5.htm) routine 
- see the website for the full details. Just for the record, and also for the 
all important purpose of flexing the biceps of my ego, I will list my personal 
records for each lift: 

Exercise: Weight (in lbs) x reps 

* Squat: 325x4 
* Bench: 315x4 
* Deadlift: 405x4 
* Rows: 225x5 
* Press: 165x4
