This summer, my girlfriend and I are moving to Florence, Italy. It's exciting.
It's scary. It's insane. And it's going to take a lot of work.

One of the first things we need to do is sell everything we own here in Menlo
Park, CA. And that means it's time for a garage sale. Of course, I'm a 
programmer, so what that really means is it's time for a **digital garage 
sale**.

Below is a list of all the items we have for sale. Some of this stuff is 
amazing and we're going to miss it dearly. Some of this stuff is crap and 
we're giving it away dirt cheap. Take a look, click on any item to go to the 
craigslist page will all the details, and if you see something you like, email 
me.

**Update**: all items have been sold. Thanks for the interest!
