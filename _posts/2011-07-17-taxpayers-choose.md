A few days ago, I wrote about how hearing [Sal Khan's 
talk](http://blog.linkedin.com/2011/04/19/speaker-series-videos/) as part of 
the [LinkedIn Speaker 
series](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?p=9A25F70FCE65AAFF) gave me an idea 
for how to [take the Khan Academy to the next 
level](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2011/07/13/taking-khan-academy-to-next-level/). 
In this post, I'll talk about an idea that was inspired by another speaker at 
LinkedIn, [Charles Best](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/charles-best/0/681/5ab) 
of [DonorsChoose.org](http://www.donorschoose.org/). If you haven't heard of 
DonorsChoose, here's the basic idea: public school teachers from all over the 
country post requests for classroom projects that need funding; visitors to 
the site can then pick the schools/teachers/projects they wish to support and 
donate money to them.

## A mixed bag 

DonorsChoose is a great idea that has raised [$85 million and helped over 5 
million students](http://www.donorschoose.org/about/impact.html). I honestly 
can't think of a more important cause than education: year after year, in 
[study](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trends_in_International_Mathematics_and_Science_Study) 
after [study](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/education/05scores.html), US 
students lag behind most other industrialized nations. [Lack of 
funding](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/01/opinion/01eggers.html) undoubtedly 
plays a big role in this, so it's great to see DonorsChoose making some 
headway in this area. 

Having said that, the fact that teachers need donations to do their job and 
that&mdash;with all due respect to the wonderful work of Charles 
Best&mdash;DonorsChoose has to exist at all, is downright disturbing. Think about it for 
a minute: the *future of this country* depends entirely on having a well 
educated population; **what kind of future can we have if teachers must beg 
for money just to be able to do their jobs**? 

## What if taxpayers could choose?

Part of the problem is that the average person has little say in how their tax 
dollars are spent. For example, when is the last time you saw a military 
general begging for money? In fact, the US spends more money on its military 
than [the next 10 countries 
combined](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures); 
the [air conditioning 
budget](http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/06/27/255014/the-hidden-cost-of-war-u-s-military-spends-20-billion-a-year-on-air-conditioning-in-iraq-and-afghanistan/) 
for Iraq and Afghanistan alone is more than NASA's entire budget. 

What if we allowed people to choose where their taxes went? Imagine a new 
section in your tax returns or even a government website where, if you wanted 
to, you could specify exactly which programs your tax dollars should go to. To 
be realistic, you'd probably only be allowed to control a relatively small 
percentage of your tax dollars, since a [direct 
democracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_democracy) at the 300 million 
person scale would never work. 

Still, I have to wonder: would the US public choose to spend nearly as much 
money on the military? Would we allow our teachers to make [significantly less 
money](http://www.epi.org/publications/entry/the_teaching_penalty_an_update_through_2010/) 
than other professions that require similar training and education? Would we 
have [cut NASA's 
budget](http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/2011/07/06/359215/us-house-appropriations-cuts-nasa-budget.html)? 

**What would you choose?**
