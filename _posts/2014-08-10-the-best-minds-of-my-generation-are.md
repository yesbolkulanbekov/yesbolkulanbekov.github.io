  There is a meme going around that too many programmers are wasting their 
  careers working on meaningless software: they spend all their time trying to 
  get people to click on ads, they aren't tackling the important stuff, and 
  they aren't solving the biggest problems of today. It's as if all programmers 
  should drop what they are doing and instead try to cure cancer, end world 
  hunger, and generally save the world. I'm going to call bullshit.

There is a meme going around that too many programmers are wasting their careers 
working on meaningless software: [they spend all their time trying to get people 
to click on ads](http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/11_17/b4225060960537.htm), 
[they aren't tackling the important stuff](http://magazine.good.is/articles/big-time-vc-why-aren-t-tech-startups-tackling-the-important-stuff), 
and they [aren't solving the biggest problems of today](http://www.christophmccann.com/blog/2014/6/23/we-have-the-potential-to-solve-the-biggest-problems-of-today). 
It's as if all programmers should drop what they are doing and instead try to 
cure cancer, end world hunger, and generally save the world. 

I'm going to call bullshit. 

First of all, don't knock ads&mdash;or, to be more accurate, don't not knock making 
money. The most well intentioned company in the world can't accomplish any of 
its lofty goals if it has no money, and for many companies, ads are the best 
way to earn that money. 

For example, you are probably one of the billion plus people who search Google 
over [100 billion times per month](http://investor.google.com/corporate/2013/founders-letter.html) (!) 
to help plan your day, learn new information, and answer questions. It's hard to 
imagine life without it. 

{% include figure.html path="blog/ads-ok/life-before-google.jpg" caption="Life Before Google" url="http://www.shoeboxblog.com/?p=15314" %}

Google also builds [maps](https://www.google.com/maps), 
[video](https://www.youtube.com/), [email](https://mail.google.com/), 
[phones](http://www.android.com/), and even more recently, they are trying to 
[provide Internet access for everyone in the 
world](http://www.google.com/loon/), [define what it means to be a healthy 
human](http://online.wsj.com/articles/google-to-collect-data-to-define-healthy-human-1406246214), 
and to create [self-driving 
cars](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2014/05/just-press-go-designing-self-driving.html). 
And *all* of this is powered by ads: [more than 90% of Google's revenue comes 
from advertising](http://news.softpedia.com/news/91-Percent-of-Google-Revenue-Still-Comes-from-Ads-392384.shtml).

If you kept in touch with your friends and family, read the news, or even 
followed a link to this blog post, it was probably through Twitter or 
Facebook. Twitter has played a part in [starting 
revolutions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter_Revolution) in several 
countries; [so has Facebook](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook_Revolution). 
In fact, almost everyone with Internet access has been touched by Facebook (they 
have [1.32 billion active monthly users](http://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/)) 
and for those without Internet access, [Facebook is trying to 
help](http://www.internet.org/). And just like Google, [90% of Twitter's 
revenue](http://www.ibtimes.com/twitter-twtr-q1-2014-earnings-preview-slumping-user-growth-offsets-strong-increase-revenue-1577387) 
and [nearly 90% of Facebook's 
revenue](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/facebook-earnings-report-the-details-are-in-the-ads/2013/10/30/ee6280be-418a-11e3-a624-41d661b0bb78_story.html) 
comes from ads.

Many talented engineers spent enormous amounts of time at these companies 
getting you to click on those ads. The result, I'd argue, has been remarkably 
world changing: three companies, driven primarily by ad clicks, have connected 
us to information and to each other like never before. It's almost as if Adam 
Smith was on to something with the whole [invisible 
hand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_hand) idea. 

But this debate isn't *really* about ads. I'm guessing what people are 
actually upset about is that so many talented developers are working on 
products that are not "important". That is, they are building software for 
their own personal amusement or financial gain instead of working for the 
benefit of us all. 

Well, here's a question: how do we determine which companies or ideas will 
most benefit the world? 

In a remarkable talk called [The Importance of 
Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsIJN4YMZZo&amp;list=PL3641A12A6ADDB4B1&amp;index=1), 
Timothy Gowers tackles this same question with regards to mathematics: 

{% include iframe.html url="//www.youtube.com/embed/BsIJN4YMZZo?list=PL3641A12A6ADDB4B1" %}

Gowers claims that most mathematicians are drawn to intellectually interesting 
problems rather than practical ones. In fact, he talks about the famous 
Cambridge mathematician G. H. Hardy, who was "perfectly content, indeed almost 
proud, that his chosen ﬁeld, Number Theory, had no applications, either then 
or in the foreseeable future. For him, the main criterion of mathematical 
worth was beauty." 

Many mathematicians prefer problems that are *beautiful* to those that are 
useful. Despite that, mathematics has been the basis for countless discoveries 
of immense practical value: physicists, chemists, engineers, programmers, and 
countless others use math on a daily basis to build all the tools and 
technology of modern society. Even Number Theory, which seems entirely like 
math for math's sake, turns out to have many practical applications, including 
[RSA encryption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)), the basis 
of all Internet security, and the reason you can use passwords, credit card 
numbers, and exchange other information online securely. Hardy would've been 
disappointed. 

{% include figure.html path="blog/ads-ok/math-interconnected.jpg" caption="Gower's diagram of math knowledge: there is no way to separate the &quot;useful&quot; and the &quot;useless&quot;" %}


Math is deeply interconnected and unpredictable: there is simply no way to know 
which parts of it will turn out to be important in the real world and which parts 
won't. The world of companies and products is similar: there is simply no way 
to know what companies or ideas will end up being a huge benefit to the world 
and which ones won't. 

For example, it would've been hard to argue an 
[algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) inspired by citation 
analysis could change the world so profoundly&mdash;even Larry Page was not 
convinced as, in the late 90's, he offered to sell the company to Excite for 
just $1.6M (today, Google is worth around $400B). Many people would scoff at 
the idea of starting a company to share podcasts, but this is actually the 
[origin of 
Twitter](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-twitter-was-founded-2011-4). As 
many as [50% of all scientific discoveries may happen by 
accident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_of_chance_in_scientific_discoveries) 
and many of the most world-changing ones were not the result of an explicit 
effort to save humanity 
([examples](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgdDQWW-7gE)). Even the [porn 
industry has had a profound impact on 
technology](http://www.pcworld.com/article/155745/porn_on_the_web.html). You 
never know what will change the world. 

There is an old Soviet joke my dad used to tell: 

> Stalin asks his staff, "how many movies do we make per year?"  
> "100 movies, Comrade Stalin."  
> "And how many of them turn out good?"  
> "10, Comrade Stalin."  
> "Alright, next year, only make the 10 good ones." 

Of course, this isn't a justification to blindly build dumb crap, 
[JerkTech](http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/03/go-disrupt-yourself/), or anything 
actively harmful. This is not an excuse to work on projects you don't care 
about nor a reason to put up with Dilbert-like jobs. This post is a call for 
moderation: it would be impractical for everyone to try to work on projects 
that obviously change the world; it would be misguided to abandon all projects 
that change the world, but not obviously. 

If you've got the passion and the skills to cure cancer or take on world 
hunger, then by all means, do it. But if you don't--and many people 
don't--it's perfectly fine to work on something else you're passionate about. 
If you can [build something people 
want](http://techcrunch.com/2006/09/02/an-interview-with-vc-paul-graham-of-ycombinator/), 
you have a chance to make the world a better place. Even if it involves ads.
