Last Friday, I got my first project up on LinkedIn Labs: [Resume 
Builder](http://resume.linkedinlabs.com/). This little app will take your 
LinkedIn profile and convert it into a beautiful resume. You just sign in with 
your LinkedIn account, pick from one of the many resume templates, customize 
what sections are visible and their order, and then print &amp; share to your 
heart's content. Some samples: [sample 
1](http://resume.linkedinlabs.com/100001), [sample 
2](http://resume.linkedinlabs.com/100002), [sample 
3](http://resume.linkedinlabs.com/100003).

The Resume Builder was my first hackday project: it won "most likely to 
launch" back in March, 2010. What motivated me was the frustration of 
maintaining my "professional profile" in multiple places. I had Word and PDF 
documents all over my computer, my [LinkedIn 
profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jbrikman), [my 
homepage](https://www.ybrikman.com/), etc. Every time I needed to send my 
resume somewhere, I wasted hours searching for the latest one and often times 
had to resort to some old version that I tracked down in my gmail "sent mail" 
folder. Once I joined LinkedIn, I figured it was time to keep my professional 
data in one place and produce all other formats from it, and I tested this 
idea out as a hackday. 

The reaction to my hackery was very positive, and while it took me a while to 
get around to it, the Resume Builder has finally been converted into a fully 
functional app. The best part was that it gave me the opportunity to learn and 
play with a number of "best of breed" technologies: Ruby on Rails, jQuery, 
Compass, SASS, the LinkedIn APIs, and Markdown. Naturally, these are all part 
of [my resume](http://resume.linkedinlabs.com/6xgq14) now. 

I created the [Resume Builder 
Blog](http://liresume.blogspot.com/2010/12/features-and-bugs.html) to track 
updates to the project as well as the [Resume Builder IdeaScale 
community](http://liresume.ideascale.com/) to give users a chance to leave 
feedback, report bugs, and vote ideas up and down. If you have some time, give 
the [Resume Builder](http://resume.linkedinlabs.com/) a try and let me know 
what you think!
