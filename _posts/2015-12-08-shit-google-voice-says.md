A few years ago, I wrote a blog post called [Shit Recruiters Say](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2013/05/07/shit-recruiters-say/),
where I shared some of the funniest and most ridiculous recruiter messages I had
seen. Today, I'm going to share another collection of funny and ridiculous
messages, but this time, from a different source: Google Voice's
[Voicemail Transcriptions](https://support.google.com/voice/answer/115986?hl=en).

Now that I'm spending a lot of time in [Italy](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2015/07/08/from-california-to-italy/),
I use [Google Voice](google.com/voice) for a lot of my calls, as it offers free
calls to the US. When someone leaves me a voicemail, Google Voice has a handy
feature that automatically transcribes the voicemail and sends an email
notification with the text. Normally, the transcription feature works reasonably
well, but when my parents call and leave a voicemail in Russian, the results
can be... amazing.

This was the first weird voicemail transcription I got by email, before I
realized what was going on. I thought it might've been a wrong number, and I was
accidentally seeing someone's secret plan unfold. That's affirmative Peter, the
eagle has landed, I repeat, the eagle has landed.

OK, yea, sure, that sounds fine.

Sounds like something straight out of the [Jive scene in Aeroplane!](https://youtu.be/RrZlWw8Di10?t=36s)
The actual voicemail *did* mention a bank, or more specifically, how I had
gotten a new *checkbook* in the mail. Henceforth, the checkbook shall be instead
known by the name "quick chicken."

No no, that's perfectly clear.

Hey now, let's keep this civil.

Woah, no need to get belligerent! I had no idea Google Voice would censor
swearing.

Yikes, who knew Google Voice could be so aggressive?

Oh yea baby.
