Yes, my shoes are very weird. Yes, I run in them. Even on pavement. No, it 
doesn't hurt. They are called [Vibram 
FiveFingers](http://www.vibramfivefingers.com/). 

I cannot count how many times I have uttered these answers in the last 3 
years. I simply cannot wear my VFFs in public without having a conversation 
about them. People find them fascinating, hilarious, ridiculous, hideous, and 
awesome. Kids point them out to their parents ("mom, look!"); people at the 
gym stare unblinkingly at them while I stretch; strangers approach me in the 
locker room while I change; everyone wants to look at them, touch them and try 
them. I've talked to so many people about these shoes that I should get some 
sort of commission from Vibram. 

In this blog post, I'll answer some of the common questions about VFFs and 
hopefully explain some of the motivation for wearing them. 

## What cushions your feet?

Many people are shocked that it's possible to run in VFFs. What they seem to 
forget is that the padded shoes most people wear today have only been around 
for a few decades. For the *millions* of years before that, humans ran either 
barefoot or in very minimal shoes/sandals. If you read [Born to 
Run](http://www.amazon.com/Born-Run-Hidden-Superathletes-Greatest/dp/0307266303), 
you'll learn of Mexico's 
[Tarahumara](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarahumara_people) tribe which has 
maintained the same running traditions for centuries. The Tarahumarans are 
able to run ultra-marathon distances in little more than [thin 
sandals](http://nishantmehrotra.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/tarahumara.jpg). 

## Isn't it bad for your knees? 

Actually, it turns out that it may be padded shoes that are bad for your 
knees. Take a look at the huge heel on your padded running shoes. This 
encourages a heel-to-toe running gait. Now take a look at your foot. See how 
there is no padding on your heel? If you try to run barefoot and land 
heel-to-toe, you'll make it only a few steps before falling over in pain. It 
turns out that "[natural gait is biomechanically impossible for any 
shoe-wearing person](http://nymag.com/health/features/46213/)". In fact, [no 
study has ever shown running shoes to prevent 
injuries](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1170253/The-painful-truth-trainers-Are-expensive-running-shoes-waste-money.html) 
and some even suggest they may increase the chance of injury. 

## But what about arch support? 

{% include figure.html path="blog/vibram/flat-foot.jpg" caption="My footprint. See the arch? Me neither." %}

I have absolutely, positively no arch in my feet. According to my 
doctor, I have lots of loose ligaments, tight tendons and bones out of place. 
As a kid, my feet used to hurt a lot, no matter what kind of shoes I tried. 
Then, one fine day, I strapped on a pair of ice skates. My feet hurt like hell 
in them the first few times, but gradually that went away. Remarkably, so did 
my foot pain when wearing shoes. It turns out that there are muscles in the 
foot that work to support it. Padded shoes and arch supports act like crutches 
and prevent those muscles from developing. Ice skating, rollerblading and 
barefoot-style running all force the foot to work and let those muscles get 
strong. Nowadays, my feet never bother me. 

## How far can you run in them? 


{% include figure.html path="blog/vibram/me-running.jpg" alt="Me running" %}

People have run marathons and ultra-marathons in VFFs and lived (and walked) 
to talk about it. My [Crossfit 
training](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2008/12/16/tribute-to-crossfit/) 
doesn't include too much long distance running, but I've done 15k in VFFs 
without issues. 

However, if you plan on getting a pair, a word to the wise: start slow. Very, 
very slow. It can take a long time for your feet to adapt to the new running 
style. Do not just go out and run your usual routine on day 1. Instead, start 
with a walk, a very short run a few days later, and gradually work your way up 
to avoid injury. Look into [POSE running](http://posetech.com/) and [barefoot 
running](http://therunningbarefoot.com/) to get a sense of the proper 
technique. 

## Vibrams are fun

The first time I wore my Vibrams, I simply wandered around town and stepped on 
every surface I could just to see what it felt like. Bricks, gravel, asphalt, 
metal grates, dirt, and grass all have a unique texture to them and there is 
something satisfying about knowing what's actually under your feet. The extra 
sensation you get from the ground seems to help balance. The light weight 
makes me feel faster when sprinting. Running care free through mud and huge 
puddles in Vibrams is also hugely entertaining; you can toss VFFs in your 
washing machine to clean them. 

In fact, I've gotten addicted to them to the point where I want to wear them 
on a day-to-day basis. I would, too, if I could go 5 steps without someone 
asking about them.
