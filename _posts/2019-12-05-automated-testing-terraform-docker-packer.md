I'm happy to share with you the video and slides from my QCon talk on how to test infrastructure code! This talk is a 
step-by-step, live-coding class on how to write automated tests for infrastructure code, including the code you write 
for use with tools such as Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, and Packer. Topics include unit tests, integration tests, 
end-to-end tests, test parallelism, retries, error handling, static analysis, and more.

You can find the video and slides on [InfoQ]({{ page.external_url }}):
