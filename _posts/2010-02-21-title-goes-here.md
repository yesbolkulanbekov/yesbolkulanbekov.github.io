*This is an essay I wrote during an all-nighter for a Freshmen Writing Seminar 
at Cornell in 2002. The professor was not impressed, but I got a kick out of 
re-reading it today and thought others might enjoy it too. This thing really 
brings me back to freshmen year in Court Hall...* 

As I sit here, at 2:00AM, with nothing but the sound of my keyboard keys 
clicking, and the cool breeze blowing across my neck, I begin to wonder how much more 
pleasant my night would've been had I not decided that a karate match with two 
of my suitemates would be the appropriate activity at 9:00PM. Granted, 
blasting "Everybody Loves Kung Fu Fighting" and jumping around the study 
lounge throwing wild kicks was far more amusing, but the difficulty I'm now 
having in keeping my eyes open gives me an inkling that maybe my time could 
have been used a bit more wisely.

If there's something every student learns the hard way, it's that time management 
consists of more than writing out "lists," creatively doodling in the day 
planner and sticking yellow post it notes all over the monitor; it's actually 
carrying through that's the hard part. As my friend George&mdash;having spent 
another four ungodly hours doing Latin, uttering all the random declensions: 
"amicus… amici… amico… amicum… ami… a, who am I kidding"&mdash;comes in and 
collapses, face down on my floor, I begin to wonder if maybe we're doing 
something wrong. It then slowly dawns on me that it's what we're not doing 
that is wrong: that is, homework, studying, sleeping, eating, and all the good 
stuff my mom yelled at me for.

Speaking of yelling, some hall mates a few doors down are now having their game of 
"penis" (where the goal is to have 2 people, one at a time, say the word 
"penis" slightly louder than the previous until they're too embarrassed to 
continue) culminate to a screaming finally; ah, the nighttime sounds of Court 
Hall. Err, right, back to the topic on hand. Actually, perhaps that's the 
problem&mdash;every little thing, whether it be study lounge kick boxing, a 
thought provoking game of "penis," or simply ignoring the collapsed Latin 
student on your floor to see which one of you will crack first and start 
laughing&mdash;just about everything seems more interesting than homework. 

Maybe it's that my door is open… always open; at least the "Cornell Policy Book" is 
being put to good use as my doorstop. Or maybe it's that I can't stop making 
three dimensional structures out of the collection of pennies on my desk; I am 
an engineer after all. Anita adds "maybe it's just me, standing here and 
talking, watching you type this essay." Yeah, that's got to be it. It's all 
Anita's fault. Everything. 

Or perhaps it's that I keep conducting "research" of procrastinology; a few 
minutes in the study lounge talking to Adrienne, Nabil and Ian has given me 
much useful data: for example, 10 minutes can vanish in just a single blink; 
Nabil can be exceptionally funny at 2:30AM; clocks put fascinating thoughts in 
my head, such as "this essay is due 11 hours and 55 minutes." Jeremy informs 
me that, "your arithmetic sucks&mdash;you have 10 hours and 55 minutes."

And that's the main symptom of procrastinitis&mdash;not until some critical time limit 
is hit, for some 1 day, for others 1 hour, do the diseased show any visible 
signs. Then, all at once, the panicking and frantic rush to do everything 
begins. Side effects include sweaty palms, trembling hands, extreme 
irritability, lack of sleep, lack of food, lack of bathroom breaks, lack of 
synonyms and, of course, the caffeine addiction. But if you order now, we'll 
not only double your order of ProcrastiNot, we'll even include the caffeine IV 
for free! 

Sounds of drunks, wandering the streets at night, filter into my room; some guy, singing 
"You've Lost That Loving Feeling" much akin to the sounds of a dying cat, 
prompts me to get up and shut the windows. As I do so, I can't help but notice 
the picture of modern art lying on my desk&mdash;the famous Campbell's Soup Cans 
by Andy Warhol. Nothing more than the red and white can with black text 
reading "Campbell's Condensed Soup&mdash;old fashioned vegetable made with beef 
stock," but revered nonetheless by critics of modern art. Perhaps, 
procrastination is an art form too&mdash;knowing exactly how much time you can 
waste to put yourself in the perfect situation, where the pressure is on, the 
clock ticking, but the work is getting done&mdash;that can be classified as 
nothing other than the work of a master, even if considered as nothing but 
ordinary laziness by those who can't appreciate our talent. 

What everyone can appreciate, however, is that procrastination, in moderation, does 
allow us to maintain at least a small level of sanity. Few things are as 
relaxing as sitting down in the middle of the day, taking a deep breath, and 
realizing that you have to do absolutely nothing. A kind of mental clarity 
arises, much akin to the feeling of taking a deep breath after swimming 
underwater for a long time, that truly rests the soul and calms the mind. 
Granted, it's almost always ruined by the sad realization that if there's 
nothing due tomorrow, then there's surely twice as much due the day after, but 
for that one moment, life is sweet.

Democritus told us that "actions always planned are never 
completed." For example, I planned to do this essay Wednesday; now, it's 
technically Friday. Provided the Sobe Green Tea has as much caffeine as my 
twitching eye would suggest, I'll hopefully have this done before sunrise. But 
how did I get here? What earth shattering event could've prevented me from 
carrying out my well devised plan?

That would be sin number 5, sloth. By nature humans are lazy; or, perhaps more 
specifically, everything in nature is lazy. Lightning always takes the 
shortest path to the ground, objects at rest will remain at rest, there are 
even whole branches of mathematics devoted to researching optimum control&mdash;in 
other words, the quickest and easiest way to do anything. Human beings will do 
everything to avoid doing anything&mdash;which is why procrastination may be the 
most contagious disease known to man. As of today, there is no known cure.

And perhaps the most ironic part of all is that laziness can often make one do 
more work: we'll spend hours searching the entire house for the remote, just 
so we don't have to get up to change the channel; we'll contort our body in 
every direction to reach a dropped item on the floor, but would never dare to 
get up and pick it up; and we'll always wait till the last minute to do 
anything, consequently taking twice as long due to sheer exhaustion and being 
over whelmed. And sadly, procrastinitis does have one more serious side 
effect: extreme nearsightedness. Once infected, we live only in the present, 
being able to see but a few feet beyond our noses. As the brain attempts to 
block out the assignment at hand, every little detail around us becomes 
vibrant and engulfs our attention; even turning the dial on my watch and 
listening to the therapeutic clicks as the titanium bezel rotates manages to 
steal my attention for a few minutes. The real decision with procrastination, 
if we ever get around to actually figuring it out, is whether the pleasure of 
now is worth the headache of later.

If I hadn't been so "busy" watching the movie "Swingers" on Wednesday but had 
instead even written half of this essay, three interesting things would've 
happened: first, I probably would've picked a totally different topic. Second, 
I might've had a more fun night, perhaps even performing a duet of "You've 
Lost that Loving Feeling." And third, I might not have been too lazy to write 
a conclusion.
