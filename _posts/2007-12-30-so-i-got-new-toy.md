After much [debate and soul 
searching](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2007/12/26/search-for-monitor/) over 
what monitor to get, a nice deal that suddenly popped up made my decision 
easy. Of course, this [150 page 
thread](http://www.hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1088497) - full of raving 
reviews and mouth watering images - on HardForum helped too. On Wednesday 
night, I ordered a Westinghouse LCD TV from newegg. On Friday afternoon 
(newegg is amazing!), it arrived at my house and the fun began. 

## The Specs 

1. Model: [Westinghouse LVM-37W3se 
monitor](http://www.westinghousedigital.com/details.aspx?itemnum=165#VALUE) 
1. Type: LCD 
1. Size: 37" 
1. Resolution: 1920*1080 (1080p) 
1. Colors: 16.7 million 
1. Contrast ratio: 1000:1 
1. Response time: 8ms 
1. Connectivity: tons of inputs, including HDMI, DVI, VGA, component and more 

## The Experience 

So what is it like using a 37" TV as a computer monitor? I tried to take some 
pictures, but believe me, they hardly do it justice. You just have to see it 
in person to get a true feel for how huge this thing is and how incredible 
images, movies, games, etc look:

## The Review 

I use my computer for a little bit of everything: 

1. Browsing the web &amp; email 
1. Productivity apps (Word, Excel, etc) 
1. 3D games (Call of Duty 4, Medieval II: Total War, Half Life 2, Hitman: 
Blood Money) 
1. Movies (DivX, DVD, HD) 
1. Photo editing 
1. Programming 

In other words, I put this monitor through the gauntlet of tests and I have to 
admit, I'm impressed. 

### Pros/Cons 

(+) Huge. 37" is an awesome size for a monitor: it's jaw-dropping big, 
but not so big you get a headache using it.  
(+) Amazingly crisp image. Everything on this 1080p screen is very detailed 
and sharp, including text, images, movies, etc.  
(+) Gaming and movies get a huge benefit from this big screen.  
(+) Surprisingly, even text benefits from the screen: the high resolution 
allows the text to be exceptionally crisp, and the large screen size allows it 
to be big, so you reduce eye strain.  
(+) Tons of inputs. The PC inputs - DVI and VGA - are especially nice as they 
let you use this screen as a computer monitor without any converters.  
(+) So far (knock on wood) this thing has been problem free: no dead pixels, 
no noticeable backlight bleeding, no ghosting.  
(+/-) Viewing angles are very solid. You can see a very slight change in 
brightness when you view it from a large angle, but you'll only notice it if 
you're really paying attention.  
(+/-) Very bright backlight. It's too bright for monitor use, but it can 
easily be turned down to acceptable levels.  
(-) No tuners. This monitor is cheap because it has absolutely no tuners, so 
you can't connect it directly to your cable. You'll need some device (cable 
box, DVD player, computer) in between to decode the signal.  
(-) The black levels are only average. At this price range, they are more than 
acceptable, but more expensive screens are able to produce much richer darks.  
(-) The colors are only average. Again, at this price range, they are more 
than acceptable, but more expensive screens are able to produce colors that 
have more depth and pop.  

## Summary 

As a computer monitor, the Westinghouse is an incredible value. For a 
great price, I got a massive screen that totally changes my movie watching and 
gaming experience. To my great surprise, all text related activities are 
improved as well: it's remarkably nice to have large, crisp text in every 
application. 

Of course, not everything is perfect. I'm upgrading to the Westinghouse from a 
[Sony FW900](http://www.hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=952788), one of the 
best CRT's ever produced. As such, I'm used to a screen that can produce 
perfect black levels and amazing colors. No, the LVM-37w3se cannot produce the 
kind of black levels and rich colors I'm used to. And yes, there are more 
expensive LCD's out there that can do better. However, the differences are not 
*that* dramatic and have little impact in day-to-day usage. 

Overall, I think the sheer size of the Westinghouse as well as the crispness 
of the images &amp; text make up for all of its shortcomings. You just cannot 
place enough value on the way such a big screen changes your computer 
experience.
