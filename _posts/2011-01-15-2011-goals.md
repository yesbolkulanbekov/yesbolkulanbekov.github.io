    The reason most people never reach their goals is that they don't define them, 
    or ever seriously consider them as believable or achievable. Winners can tell 
    you where they are going, what they plan to do along the way, and who will be 
    sharing the adventure with them.

I'm going to use this post to list and track my 
goals for 2011. The list is ambitious, possibly just beyond reach, just like 
every list of goals should be. I had lots of fun looking back at my [life 
goals](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2010/01/28/my-life-goals/) from time to 
time and contemplating which of them I could attempt this year.
