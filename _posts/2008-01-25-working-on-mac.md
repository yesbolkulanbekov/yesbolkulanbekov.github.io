At my new job (at [TripAdvisor](http://www.tripadvisor.com/)), we were given 
the following choice for the work computer: 

1. Linux workstation 
1. Macbook Pro 

The vast majority of my computing life has been spent on Windows, so either 
choice would present a significant change. I picked the [Macbook 
Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/) because I like the portability of a 
laptop: it lets me easily work from home, I can bring it with me to a meeting 
and also use it for non-work purposes.  As I will be spending a lot of time on 
this thing, I will be posting my impressions of the transition here. 

## The Hardware 

1. MacBook Pro 
1. Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2 Ghz (dual core) 
1. 2GB ddr2 800 RAM 
1. 15" widescreen display, 1440*900 
1. nVidia Geforce 8600GM GT 
1. 120GB HD 
1. OSX 10.5 Leopard 

Since Macs and PCs use essentially the same hardware nowadays, there is 
nothing unusual here. It's a very solid system with enough horsepower to let 
me run Eclipse, a web server and half a dozen apps at the same time reasonably 
well. The only standout feature is the built in webcam, which has been largely 
useless to me, but is a neat toy with some fun software. 

The only noticeable difference with Apple's hardware is the meticulous effort 
Apple takes in the look and feel. The whole notebook has a nice steel look 
with lots of rounded edges. The Apple logo on the back of the LCD lights up 
when you are using it and the tiny LED on the front of the laptop will slowly 
pulsate when you put it to sleep. Even the wires are made out of a nice white 
plastic and have simple very Apple-esque designs. 

Overall, it's an attractive package, which is far more than I can say for my 
last laptop, the [IBM ThinkPad 
T43](http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=2285). Apple takes real 
pride in its design and it's not shy about telling you that: when you open the 
box the laptop comes in, the first thing you see is a large piece of black 
cardboard, in the middle of which is proudly proclaimed, in elegant white 
text: 

> Designed by Apple in California

...of course, it *doesn't* say built by Chinese and Mexicans in sweat shops :) 

## The Software: The Good

There is one thing OS X has going for it that I desperately want in windows: 
the search box in the top right corner of almost every application window. You 
can see it in Finder, Spotlight, the Mail program, System Preferences, iCal, 
iTunes and tons of other programs. In each case, the program indexes its 
contents (the song names in iTunes, your email in Mail, etc) and as you type 
something into the search box, it instantly filters the results to just items 
that contain the search terms. It makes launching a program, finding files, 
finding emails, etc extremely quick and efficient. It's available to some 
extent on Windows with third party apps such as Launchy and Google Desktop, 
but system wide integration in OS X is incredibly nice. 

OS X comes preloaded with a ton of software. Given that Microsoft was sued for 
including Internet Explorer with Windows, I don't know how Apple gets away 
with it, but OS X users should be happy. Some of the software I really like: 
iTunes is a very solid media manager. The Mail program and iCal blow away 
Outlook and its calendar, and you only get Outlook if you shell out extra 
money on MS Office. iMovie (from watching others use it) seems very 
impressive, especially when stacked up against Windows Movie faker. 

iPhoto, iChat, and Safari I'm less thrilled with. They get the job done, but 
aren't anything out of the norm. Widgets (which are available for XP and 
Vista) I don't like on any OS. The Preview app, which is unique only for its 
"cover flow" ability is very pretty, but honestly, fairly useless. Thumbnail 
view, while not as pretty, is a much more efficient way to find something 
visually. Finally, spaces is a neat (although very old) idea, and the 
execution is decent, but as I have multiple monitors at work, I have no use 
for it. I also haven't tried GarageBand or Time Machine yet, although I hear 
good things. 

OS X can also be fairly intelligent and well integrated. It does a lot for you 
(sometimes too much) that can be quiet useful. For example, as soon as you 
plug a monitor into the DVI port, it turns it on and extends your desktop onto 
it. In Windows, I'd have to dig through several annoying menus (which differ 
widely depending on your video card) to enable the second monitor. If you 
highlight a date or time in the Mail program it gives you the option to add an 
event for that time to iCal. If you have an icon for your user in OS X, Adium 
(a nice multi protocol chat client) will automatically use it as your buddy 
icon. Network computers are effortlessly visible in Finder which, as odd as it 
sounds, can sometimes make it easier to connect to even Windows networks on a 
Mac. 

## The Software: The Bad

Given the specs, OS X wasn't as responsive as I'd expect. It's  by no means 
slow, but when launching apps and multitasking, there's a small amount of lag. 
I would guess that, like Windows Vista, all the extra graphical effects cause 
a bit of a slowdown. 

Some small keyboard issues really irritate me on OS X. I understand the Apple 
button replacing the Windows button, but the changes are far deeper than that 
and oddly inconsistent. For example, if you push the Alt button in Windows, it 
highlights a menu at the top of the application. `Alt + F` often highlights the 
File menu. You can then use your arrow keys to browse the menu. OS X, as far 
as I can tell, doesn't have this. You either need to know the keyboard 
shortcut ahead of time or use the mouse. 

The home and end buttons go to the beginning and end of a *page*, which is 
unlike every other OS on the planet, where they go to the beginning and end of 
a *line*. To emulate the proper behavior of home and end in OS X, you have to 
use `Apple + Arrow Keys`. This is an awkward combo to push and in 
Firefox, this actually will activate the back and forward buttons of the 
browser, which is a serious issue! Moreover, when using Firefox, instead of 
`CTRL + T` to open a new tab, you use `Apple + T`. But to switch between tabs, 
it's `CTRL + Tab`, same as in Windows. Obviously, some of this frustration is 
just the pain of switching between OS's, but a lot of it is inconsistent and 
illogical and could have been avoided. 

Another odd thing is that when you close a program by clicking the red circle 
in the top left corner (the x)... it doesn't actually close. The window 
disappears and makes you think the program is closed, but secretly, the 
program keeps running. Your only clues are that the program still shows up 
when you `Apple + Tab` between programs. To actually close it, you have to use 
the menu or push `Apple + Q`. This seems like a very non user-friendly design, 
which is odd coming from Apple. 

Browsing for files in Finder&mdash;largely because of the way user accounts are 
handled in Unix&mdash;is a bit unintuitive as well. It's often hard to see the 
proper file hiearchy, it's even more difficult to see files *above* your 
user's file hiearchy (this is somewhat by design) and the shortcuts in the 
left pane ("Macintosh HD", "Desktop", "Applications") only add to the 
confusion as you have no idea where in this hiearchy they fit. This is painful 
to someone coming from Windows, where I'm used to seeing every file and folder 
on the entire system. It is somewhat mitigated due to the wonderful 
aforementioned search feature but the file layout really should be cleaner. 

## Conclusion 

Despite everything I say above, to be perfectly honest, during 
day-to-day usage, there is not much difference between OS X 10.5 and Windows 
XP. In the end, I'm still browsing the web with Firefox, coding in Eclipse, 
browsing files and folders, typing commands at a prompt and so on. Despite all 
the marketing hype, these two OS's are not polar opposites. They both do a few 
things very well and a few things very poorly. Everything in between&mdash;which 
is probably 98% of what you do with your computer anyway&mdash;is a matter of 
personal preference. 

Personally, I would not buy a Mac for myself for a few of reasons: 

* I build my own PC's, out of just the parts I want, which you can't really do 
with a Mac, although that's slowly starting to change as Macs use more and 
more standard hardware. 
* Macs have far fewer games available. 
* Actually, in general the amount of software available for the PC is greater 
than for the Mac. This is largely because the PC market is so much larger, but 
it's certainly worth considering. 

Apple has come a long way from the original iMac and I'm relieved to say that 
OS X is a very solid OS. Given that the pre ~10.2 Mac OS's used to make me 
gag, this is pretty high praise. And who knows, maybe after using it for long 
enough at work, it'll start to grow on me. Or drive me nuts. We'll see.
