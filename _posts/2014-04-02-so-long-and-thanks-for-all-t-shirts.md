In 2009, I joined LinkedIn as a Software Engineer. 5 years, 50 t-shirts, 60 
hackdays, 4000 employees, several hundred million members, a billion dollars 
in revenue, and 1 IPO later, I'm moving on to my [next 
play](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/11/business/jeff-weiner-of-linkedin-on-the-next-play-philosophy.html?_r=0). 
My last day will be in a couple weeks, and for the next few months after that, 
I'm going to relax, travel, and think. 

LinkedIn transformed my career. I got the chance to work on amazing projects, 
including [LinkedIn 
Recruiter](http://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/products/recruiter.html), 
[Hackdays](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUwEEOhcK3s), [Resume 
Builder](http://resume.linkedinlabs.com/), the [LinkedIn 
Platform](http://developer.linkedin.com/), the [LinkedIn Engineering 
Blog](http://developer.linkedin.com/), 
[Incubator](http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/12/07/linkedin-incubator/), [Play at 
LinkedIn](http://engineering.linkedin.com/play/play-framework-linkedin), 
[LinkedIn Open Source](http://linkedin.github.io/), and much more. I learned 
many new technologies, [saw amazing 
talks](http://blog.linkedin.com/topic/linkedin-indays/linkedin-speaker-series/), 
and [traveled the world](https://ybrikman.com/photos). But most 
importantly, I got to work with an incredible group of people. [Relationships 
matter](http://blog.linkedin.com/2013/05/05/linkedin-turns-10/), and the 
relationships I built at LinkedIn will be with me for the rest of my career. 

Thank you to everyone who made it possible. 

I leave you with some photos that capture a few of the highlights of my time 
at LinkedIn.
