Last year was a bit crazy. I published a [book](https://www.hello-startup.net/); I started a
[company](https://www.gruntwork.io/); Molly and I sold everything we owned and did a cross-country road trip,
with stops at the [Bonneville Salt Flats](https://goo.gl/photos/bwvNiSDERrmiaBdr5), [Grand
Teton](https://goo.gl/photos/UB476Xvp8NwjtM1W7), [Yellowstone](https://goo.gl/photos/xvN75XBhqgeznCS39), [Devil's
Tower](https://goo.gl/photos/Hy8Bf62NNaK2psV39), the [Badlands](https://goo.gl/photos/G3LW6fq21oxynk6QA), and
[Chicago](https://goo.gl/photos/ZfEkY7TkhM6DdKoJ9); and then we moved to
[Italy](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2015/07/08/from-california-to-italy/).

The craziness continues this year. Molly got a job at [Trinity College in Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie/), so the two of
us are moving to Ireland.

In preparation, we watched [Father Ted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Father_Ted), twice, and now we are fecking ready
for this next adventure. But first, I must say goodbye the same way as I did when I [left
LinkedIn](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2014/04/02/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-t-shirts/) and when I [moved out of
California](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2015/07/08/from-california-to-italy/): with some photo memories.

Thank you Italy for one of the most fun years of my life.
