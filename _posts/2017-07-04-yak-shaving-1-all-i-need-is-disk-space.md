I just published the first entry in [The Yak Shaving Series](https://blog.gruntwork.io/introducing-the-yak-shaving-series-247e7f20f81), 
where we share stories of some of the unexpected, bizarre, painful, and time-consuming problems weâ€™ve had to solve 
while working on DevOps and infrastructure: [{{ page.title }}]({{ page.external_url }})

It is a horror movie that involves AWS, Terraform, Auto Scaling Groups, EBS Volumes, and Bash. Enjoy!
