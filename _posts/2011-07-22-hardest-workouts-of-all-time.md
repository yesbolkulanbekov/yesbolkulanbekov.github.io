What are the toughest, most mentally and physically challenging workouts that 
you've ever done? There are [many](http://www.spccrossfit.com/?page_id=1162) 
[discussions](http://www.t-nation.com/free_online_article/sports_body_training_performance/the_six_toughest_workouts) 
[online](http://board.crossfit.com/showthread.php?t=23056) on this topic, so I 
figured I'd add my own opinion to the mix. These are in no particular order; 
just a list of things that absolutely, positively destroyed me. 

## 20 rep squats 

{% include figure.html path="blog/hardest-workouts/deep-squat.jpg" alt="Squat" %}

1. Load a barbell with a load you normally squat for ~10 reps
1. Unrack the barbell
1. Don't rack it again until you've done 20 reps

Back in 2009, I did 20 rep squats once every week as part of my 
[Crossfit hybrid 
routine](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2009/07/12/crossfit-strengthpower-hybrid/). 
I started at 205lbs and each time I got through all 20 reps, I'd add 5-10lbs 
for next week. I made it up to 300lbs for a set of 20 before quitting. It was 
without a doubt the longest, most excruciatingly unpleasant, 
dear-god-make-it-stop-can't-breath single set of any exercise I've ever done. 
This is why 20 rep squats have been nicknamed "widow makers", "man breakers", 
"breathing squats", and "death sets" and are discussed 
[all](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/irontamer5.htm) 
[over](http://startingstrength.wikia.com/wiki/20_Rep_Squats) the 
[web](http://www.ironworkout.com/20_rep_squat.htm). 

I have to admit that, week after week, 20 rep squats were the one workout I 
*dreaded*. I typically did them on Wednesdays and would spend all day at work 
thinking about them and trying to come up with excuses for skipping the gym. 
Once the weight got heavy, I'd be sore for days after the 20 rep workout. 
Having said that, they were also extremely effective. I saw [huge gains in 
2009](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2010/01/06/look-back-at-2009/) both in 
terms of mental toughness and overall strength: squat +90lbs, deadlift +50lbs, 
overhead press +30lbs, power clean +50lbs, snatch +60lbs, etc. 

## Eva 

{% include figure.html path="blog/hardest-workouts/eva.jpg" alt="Eva" %}

Five rounds for time of: 

1.  Run 800 meters 
1.  2 pood Kettlebell swing, 30 reps 
1.  30 Pull-ups 

Like most [Crossfit](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2008/12/16/tribute-to-crossfit/) 
workouts, [Eva](http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/004780.html) is done "for 
time", which means you try to get through the workout as fast as you possibly 
can. Unlike most Crossfit workouts, Eva makes me want to quit long before I'm 
done. The combination of 2.5 miles of running, 150 heavy KB swings and 150 
pull-ups destroys my lungs, legs, and grip. It's a 45-60 minute nightmare of a 
workout and it takes every bit of my willpower to pick up that kettlebell each 
round. 

## Rowing and burpees

{% include figure.html path="blog/hardest-workouts/rowing.jpg" alt="Rowing" %}

For time: 

1. Row 1000 meters 
1. 25 Burpees 
1. Row 750 meters 
1. 50 Burpees 
1. Row 500 meters 
1. 75 Burpees 

Rowing and burpees both have the ability to get my heart rate through the 
roof. Putting together 2250m of rowing and 150 burpees made me feel like my 
chest would explode. I've only done this workout once and am not sure I ever 
want to do it again. 

## Inverted burpees

{% include figure.html path="blog/hardest-workouts/inverted-burpee.jpg" alt="Inverted burpee" %}

Five rounds for time of: 

1.  25 [Inverted Burpees](http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/001125.html) 
1.  25 Pull-ups 
1.  25 Burpees 

You know what's worse than burpees? [Inverted 
burpees](http://www.crossfit.com/mt-archive2/001125.html). Seriously, these 
things are downright mean. And 125 of them - in addition to 125 pull-ups and 
125 normal burpees - is just plain evil. 

## 400m repeats

{% include figure.html path="blog/hardest-workouts/running.jpg" alt="Running" %}

This may seem like a strange one, but I'm not sure any other workout allows me 
to approach 100% exertion quite like all-out 400m repeats. I'm actually a 
pretty terrible runner and suffer at any distance, but 400m has a special 
place in my heart. It starts out easy, but before you know it, every muscle in 
your body is burning and your [veins are pumping battery 
acid](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/quotes).
