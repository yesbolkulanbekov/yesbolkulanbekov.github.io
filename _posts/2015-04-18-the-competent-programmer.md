In literature, [The Competent (Wo)man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competent_man)
is a character who exhibits a very wide range of abilities and knowledge. The 
idea is similar to a Polymath or a Renaissance (Wo)man, and captured 
beautifully in this quote by Robert A. Heinlein:

<blockquote>
  <p>
    A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher 
    a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, 
    build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, 
    cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, 
    program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. 
    Specialization is for insects.
  </p>

One of my ambitions in life is to become a **Competent Programmer**. Today, I
came across a variation on Heinlein's quote that beautifully captures
this idea:

<blockquote>
  <p>
    A programmer should be able to find a bug, market an application, refactor 
    a spike, lead a team, architect an application, hack a kernel, schedule a 
    project, build a database, route a network, give a reference, implement 
    user stories, analyze user stories, work in a team, work alone, use 
    patterns, innovate, write documentation, have a real life, create a cool 
    website, email efficiently, resign gracefully, admit ignorance, and keep on 
    learning. Specialization is for recruiters.

I've never understood developers who describe themselves as a "PHP Programmer" 
or a "C++ Programmer". Libraries and programming languages are tools, and 
calling yourself a "C++ Programmer" is a bit like if you were a Carpenter and 
called yourself a "Hammer++ Swinger"&mdash;it suggests a very limited tool belt.
It also suggests that you're missing the bigger picture. You don't hire a 
carpenter to swing a hammer. You hire a carpenter to build a house. Similarly,
you don't hire a programmer to build PHP apps or write C++. *You hire 
programmers to solve problems*. 

Some of those problems may require you to use PHP or C++, some of the problems 
need many languages at once, and many of the most important problems have 
nothing to do with the programming language at all, such as data modeling, 
system design, planning, testing, communication, and hiring. This is why I 
wrote a [book](https://www.hello-startup.net/?ref=a-programmer-should)
that teaches programmers not only to write code, but also come up with business
ideas, design products, figure out sales and marketing, define a company 
culture, and build a team. Of course, it's still a good idea to become an expert
at one or two skills, just not at the cost of all others. So instead of 
becoming a one-dimensional expert, strive to build both deep and broad 
knowledge, or to become what the
[Valve New Employee Handbook](https://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf)
calls a "T-shaped person": 

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <strong>We value "T-shaped" people.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    That is, people who are both generalists (highly skilled at a broad set of 
    valuable things&mdash;the top of the T) and also experts (among the best in 
    their field within a narrow discipline&mdash;the vertical leg of the T).

Instead of a "Hammer Swinger", strive to be a "House Builder". Instead of a "C++ 
Programmer", strive to be a "Programmer who has used C++ on project XXX". 
Instead of a "C++ Programmer", strive to be a **Competent Programmer**.
