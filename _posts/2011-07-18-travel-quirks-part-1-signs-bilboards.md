When I'm traveling, I'm a compulsive photographer: my camera is always out and 
clicking. Photograph first, ask questions later. Some people get annoyed at 
this, but I love the result: a huge 
[gallery](https://picasaweb.google.com/brikis98) of all my adventures that 
provides me an endless supply of smiles &amp; nostalgia for years to come. 

I've decided to blog about some of my travels, but rather than the standard 
"look at me in front of famous location X" and "here we are at tourist trap Y" 
style blog post, I decided to do a series of posts on the quirkier photos I've 
taken. Travel is full of the unplanned, unexpected, and the unimaginable. Of 
course, this is exactly why everyone should do it: discovering things that are 
new and different makes you a more complete person. 

But don't expect any major revelations from this series of posts. Just sit 
back and enjoy the quirkiness of the world we live in, starting today with 
strange signs, billboards and writings.

  <figcaption>Prague, Czech Republic</figcaption>

The Museum of Communism in Prague is conveniently located next to a casino and 
right above a McDonald's. In the words of Rick Steves, "Lenin must be turning 
over in his grave".

I can only wonder how humans figured out that these are the most effective 
rules for dealing with mountain lions. The "pick up children without bending" 
is particularly intriguing in a martial-arts-movie-standoff kind of way.

  <figcaption>Sedlec Bone Church, Kutna Hora, Czech Republic</figcaption>
</figure>

Monks used the bones  of 40,000 people&mdash;victims of Plagues and wars&mdash;to 
decorate the  church. Imagine 
[chandeliers](https://picasaweb.google.com/brikis98/KutnaHora#5214064714560046258), 
[altars](https://picasaweb.google.com/brikis98/KutnaHora#5214064486926779474) and 
[coat of arms](https://picasaweb.google.com/brikis98/KutnaHora#5214064607185863810) 
made entirely of bones. This is the signature of the head monk responsible.

"Parking for Latvians only". We ran into this in a random parking lot in San 
Mateo. Somebody must have thought they were being extremely clever with this 
sign and that no one would dare park in their spot. Imagine their surprise 
when I showed up.

  <figcaption>Ministry of Ministries, Berlin, Germany</figcaption>

Much like the bureaucracy that was housed in the Ministry of Ministries, this 
sign had issues.

This guy's face was all over Budapest.

  <figcaption>Checkpoint Charlie Museum, Berlin, Germany</figcaption>
</figure>

I wonder if East Germany was the first city in human history where walls were 
built not to keep invaders out, but to keep the population *in*.

  <figcaption>Neues Museum, Berlin, Germany</figcaption>
</figure>

The huge tablet on the right, which was perhaps 4 feet wide, 2 feet tall and 1 
foot high, was labeled as a "small letter". Apparently, "mailman" was a 
demanding profession in Ancient Greece.
