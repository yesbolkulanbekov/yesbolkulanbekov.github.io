LinkedIn dedicates one Friday every month to an 
"[InDay](http://blog.linkedin.com/2011/05/24/linkedin-inday/)" where employees 
are allowed to spend time on something they are passionate about that is 
outside their normal day-to-day tasks. You can use the day to learn a new 
skill, [participate in 
Hackday](http://blog.linkedin.com/category/linkedin-hackdays/), or spend your 
time volunteering and helping out the community. In addition to this, guest 
speakers are invited as part of the [LinkedIn speakers 
series](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?p=9A25F70FCE65AAFF), giving employees 
a chance to interact with some incredible people. 

One of my favorites was [an interview with Salman 
Khan](http://blog.linkedin.com/2011/04/19/speaker-series-videos/) of the [Khan 
Academy](http://www.khanacademy.org/). If you don't know who he is or what the 
Khan Academy is all about, you *need* to take the time to watch the following 
TED talk:

The idea is beautiful: invert the classroom and let students watch lectures at 
home&mdash;at their own pace&mdash;and reserve class time for purely teacher-student 
and student-student interaction. The funny thing is that this is something 
I've unwittingly done many times before: for example, in college, I would 
frequently skip (or sleep through) lectures and instead learn everything I 
needed on my own time (and pace) from the book/homework/projects; I would fill 
in any gaps in my knowledge by getting together with other students or 
one-on-one time with a professor or TA during office hours. I'm not sure who 
decided that one guy rambling for hours in front of 30+ students was the best 
way to teach people, but I think the Khan Academy is going to prove them 
wrong. 

However, there seems to be one big opportunity that the Khan Academy has 
missed. 

## The Great Library 

As far as I can tell, all the [Khan Academy videos 
](http://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy)thus far are recorded by Sal Khan 
himself. With all due respect to Sal Khan and his superb work, what if we 
allowed *other* teachers to create videos for the various educational units? 
Imagine if teachers all over the world started submitting their own versions 
of [Quadratic 
Inequalities](http://www.khanacademy.org/video/quadratic-inequalities?playlist=Algebra), 
[Scientific Notation 
1](http://www.khanacademy.org/video/scientific-notation-i?playlist=Developmental%20Math), 
and [The Chain 
Rule](http://www.khanacademy.org/video/the-chain-rule?playlist=Calculus). If 
one video didn't make a topic "click", a student could try another one to get 
a different perspective on the subject. Moreover, if we let students rate 
these videos, the best ones would filter to the top, similar to 
[reddit](http://www.reddit.com/). As a secondary rating, we could even factor 
in the average score on the test modules after a student watches a given video 
to see how effective the video really was. Given enough time and enough 
teachers willing to record their lectures, the Khan Academy could gradually 
turn into a modern day equivalent of the [Library of 
Alexandria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria). 

**The Khan Academy could become the source for the best possible instruction *in the entire world* on any given subject.**

## The Great Masters

Think about it: chances are that the absolute best person to teach any given 
topic *X* is (a) not Sal Khan and (b) does not work in your child's school 
district. However, if that teacher recorded his lectures and made them 
available at the Khan Academy, your child would be able to learn from him, as 
would your grandchildren, great grand children and all future generations. If 
this technology was around a few hundred years ago, your child today might 
have been able to learn calculus from Isaac Newton or physics from Richard 
Feynman.

The Internet is all about instant access to unparalleled 
amounts of information. The Khan Academy has made education more accessible 
than ever. If they allow teachers everywhere to contribute, it may become the 
greatest source of learning in human history.
