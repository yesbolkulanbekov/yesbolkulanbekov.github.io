---

I use my computer daily for a variety of tasks, including: 

1. Browsing the web 
1. Playing games 
1. Watching movies 
1. Programming 
1. Photo editing 

My current monitor is the [Sony 
FW900](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-GDM-FW900-Widescreen-Trinitron-Monitor/dp/B00004YNSR), 
the enormous god of the CRT world. The specs: 

1. It's 24", 22.5" viewable 
1. Widescreen (16:10) 
I run it at 1920x1200, although since it's a CRT, it also handles any 
resolution below that with ease (which is awesome for gaming!) 
1. Great colors, contrast &amp; blacks 
1. Totally flat screen 
1. Excellent detail, with text as sharp as any LCD 
1. It weighs ~95lbs! 

It has been a great monitor, but I'm thinking of giving it to my dad. He likes 
to run his dying 19" CRT at 800x600 to make the text HUGE. Since LCD's 
typically look blurry at anything but their non-native resolution - and the 
native resolution would always have smaller fonts than what he wants - it 
probably makes the most sense to give him my CRT rather than buy him a new 
LCD. 

## Requirements 

So now my quest is to find a replacement for myself. The requirements for my 
new monitor are as follows: 

1. It must be an LCD: I want something thin, so CRT &amp; DLP are out. Plasma 
won't work as a monitor, as they are subject to burn in. A projector with a 
high resolution is absurdly expensive. 
1. The resolution must be 1920x1080 (1080p) or above. Any less and I'd be 
losing out on valuable resolution for productivity applications and it would 
feel like a step down from my current screen. 
1. The screen size must be 27" or above. Any less and it wouldn't feel like 
much of an upgrade over the behemoth screen I have now. 
1. The colors, contrast &amp; black levels must be very strong. I doubt any 
(affordable) LCD can match the FW900, but I'm sure many are "good enough". 

## Display Types 

The requirements above leave me with 3 possible monitor types: 

### 27" or 28" LCD monitor

(+) Color/blacks performance can be very strong.   
(+) Probably the cheapest option.  
(+/-) 1920x1200 resolution (same as I have now)  
(-) Screen size isn't *that* much bigger, so games/movies would look roughly 
the same  
(-) If I have to lower the resolution for gaming, either I'd have to deal with 
scaling (crappier quality) or if I do 1:1 pixel matching, I'd effectively be 
playing on a smaller screen (defeats the purpose of upgrading).  

### 30" LCD monitor 

(+) Ridiculously high 2560x1600 resolution is amazing for productivity   
(+) Color/black performance should be excellent  
(+) 30" screen would be a noticeable upgrade in size  
(-) I can't possibly run games at that resolution, so either I'd have to deal 
with scaling (crappier quality) or if I do 1:1 pixel matching, I'd effectively 
be playing on a smaller screen (defeats the purpose of upgrading).  
(-) Very expensive  

### 32"+ LCD tv

(+) Enormous screen size is amazing for movies + gaming  
(+) There are 120Hz models which are still more amazing for movies  
(+/-) Resolution maxes out at 1920x1080, so it's a *slight *step down in 
resolution  
(+/-) If I can't run a game at this resolution, I'd either have to deal with 
scaling (crappier quality) or if I do 1:1 pixel matching, I'd effectively be 
playing on a smaller screen. However, since the screen is so much larger 
already, even at a lower resolution with 1:1 it would still be pretty big.  
(+/-) Color/black level performance is much more mixed  
(-) There aren't many high quality 1080p sets below the 42" size, which would 
probably be WAY too big just a few feet away from me on my desk  
(-) Typically pretty expensive  

## The Options 

Based on all the above, here are the candidates for each category: 

### 27" or 28" LCD monitor

* [Dell 
2707WFP](http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;sku=222-7315): 
27", 1920x1200, true 8 bit colors. May be a bit slow for gaming and is 
expensive (~$1000) for the size/features. 
* [Samsung 
275T](http://www.samsung.com/ca/products/monitor/lcd_widescreen/ls27hubcbxaa.asp): 
27", 1920x1200, true 8 bit colors, incredible blacks &amp; contrast. 
Apparently faster than the Dell, but might not support 1:1 mapping and is also 
expensive (~$1000). 
* [Hanns.G 
HG-281DPB](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824254026): 
28", 1920x1200, super fast 3ms response time. Color accuracy is nowhere near 
as good as the Samsung and Dell, but at under $600 this is definitely the 
budget option. 

### 30" LCD monitor

* [Dell 
3007WFP](http://accessories.us.dell.com/sna/productdetail.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=19&amp;sku=222-7175): 
30", 2560x1600, true 8 bit colors. Should be amazing all around. Costs around 
$1200. 
* [Samsung 
305T](http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/detail/spec.do?group=computersperipherals&amp;type=monitors&amp;subtype=lcd&amp;model_cd=LS30HUBCB/XAA&amp;fullspec=F): 
30", 2560x1600, true 8 bit colors. Should be amazing all around. Costs around 
$1300. 

### 32"+ LCD tv

* [Sharp Aquos 
LC32GP1U](http://www.amazon.com/Sharp-Aquos-LC32GP1U-1080p-Gaming/dp/B000NKAYWG): 
32", 1920x1080, 2000:1 native contrast, 6ms response. Colors seem decent and 
response time should be terrific for gaming. However, I've heard of numerous 
issues with this screen, especially that the dynamic contrast can't be shut 
off and can be very annoying when using it as a monitor. Price is around 
$1100. 
* [Westinghouse 
LVM-37W3SE](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16889234025&amp;Tpk=westinghouse%2b37): 
37", 1920x1080, 1000:1 native contrast, 8ms response. Colors, blacks and 
contrast will be fairly crappy. The response time and crisp image should be 
amazing. This is also a huge screen, so movies &amp; gaming should be 
incredible. At around $800, this is also one hell of a bargain. 
* [Samsung 
LNT4071F](http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-LNT4071F-1080p-120Hz-HDTV/dp/B000U9ZCQS/ref=pd_ecc_rvi_cart_2): 
40", 1920x1080, 25000:1 (dynamic), 8ms, 120hz. Colors and contrast should be 
incredible. Movies (esp. w/ 120hz) and games will look phenomenal. However, 
40" may be too big on my desk and the price (~$1550) is quite steep. 

## Conclusion 

All in all, this is a tough choice. I think the 27"/28" screens are out of the 
running: given the price, they aren't much of an upgrade and for gaming (where 
I'd have to lower the resolution), they'd be a worse investment still. The 30" 
screen sounds very enticing, but again, if I try gaming I might be very 
disappointed. Therefore, I'm now leaning towards the large LCD TV's. I might 
be able to game at their native resolution, and if not, even with 1:1 mapping, 
the image will *still* be huge. However, due to the lack of smaller 1080p 
TV's, my best bet is probably the 40" Samsung, but that might give me a 
headache from being way too big to sit close to.
