The other day, I was going through some old files on my computer, and stumbled 
across a paper that blew my mind. It was a technical write up of an experiment 
with thermistors and Alexandrite Lasers and included discussions of 
temperature control, feedback systems, circuit diagrams, and lots of other 
technologies and techniques I know nothing about. Here's what amazed me: the 
author listed at the top of the paper... was me. 

Yup, this was a paper I had written for an [AEP](http://www.aep.cornell.edu/) 
course at Cornell about a decade ago (yes, I'm a bit [obsessed with 
organization](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2011/07/23/obsessed-with-lists-how-i-organize-my/) 
and still have most of the projects I did in college). Even though I had spent 
lots of time on the experiment, the write-up, and had understood all the 
details back then... I not only can't remember it now, I don't even recognize 
it as something I could have known. The paper may as well have been written by 
someone else.

It's as if a different person had lived that life and written that paper. That 
person and I share a name; we share *some*&mdash;though clearly not 
all&mdash;memories; and we look somewhat similar. But we are not the same person. 

It's hard to see things like this and not ponder a bit on human life. We speak 
of it as a single, continuous experience, but I think the reality is that we 
each live many, many lives. 

## A Thousand Lives

We form our first memories&mdash;live our first life&mdash;around the age of 1 or 2. 
Only a few years later, those memories die from [childhood 
amnesia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_amnesia), and we start our 
next life.

Must keep swimming We spend much of our childhood reading books, watching 
movies, and living a hundred different fantasy lives. A princess, a superhero, 
a wizard, a vampire&mdash;kids try them all.

Then we grow up and travel a bit, living lives in other places, perhaps as 
other people. We go to college far away from home, study abroad, backpack in 
Europe.

There are some memories&mdash;some lives&mdash;that we try to forget.

    <strong>Howard</strong>: Well, technically speaking, the operation is brain damage, but 
    it's on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss. 
  </p>

There are some that we forget accidentally.

Sometimes, we leave bits and pieces for our future selves.

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: So when Lily and I get married... who is gonna get the apartment?</p>
  <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Wow... that's a tough one. Y'know who I think could handle a problem like that?</p>
  <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Who?</p>
  <p><strong>Ted</strong>: Future Ted &amp; Future Marshall.</p>
  <p><strong>Marshall</strong>: Totally. Let's let those guys handle it.</p>
</blockquote>

And every single night, we lie down, and in our dreams, live still more lives. 
Is the person who wakes up the same as the one who fell asleep?

A cat has nine lives; a human has a thousand. Enjoy them.
