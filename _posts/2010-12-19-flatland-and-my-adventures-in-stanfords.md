I almost forgot to post this tale, but I recently ran across the relevant 
photos on my phone and knew I had to write something. 

A few months ago, in preparation for a trip up to Sonoma, Molly and I were at 
the Stanford Library to pick out a few books. Susan's house in Healdsburg is 
one of the few places I actually take the time to read, as opposed to 
listening to audiobooks; after a day of biking, wine tasting and swimming, 
there is nothing better than relaxing by the pool with a good story. Except 
the massages. But that's a different story.

I keep track of all the books I read&mdash;and all the books I want to read&mdash;on [Visual 
Bookshelf](http://books.livingsocial.com/people/1716910290), so I had my list 
ready when we got to the library. I found the nearest computer and began to 
search. First up was Richard Dawkins' [The Selfish 
Gene](http://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Gene-Richard-Dawkins/dp/0192860925). They 
had a copy, but it seemed to be on hold. Next up: [The Pragmatic 
Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X). 
Somebody already had it out. I then tried 
[Xenocide](http://www.amazon.com/Xenocide-Ender-Book-Orson-Scott/dp/0812509250), 
the 3rd book in the Ender's Game series. They had it! I wrote down the call 
number and headed down to the stacks with Molly. 

20 minutes later, we came back to the terminal empty handed. The book was 
nowhere to be found. I continued searching. [The 
Island](http://www.amazon.com/Island-Perennial-Classics-Aldous-Huxley/dp/0060085495)? 
Out. [The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' 
Nest](http://www.amazon.com/Girl-Who-Kicked-Hornets-Nest/dp/1906694176)? Lost. 
I tried a few more and finally got a hit for [One Hundred Years of 
Solitude](http://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Solitude-Gabriel-Garcia-Marquez/dp/0060929790) 
in another library. We wandered over there and, sure enough, it was missing 
from the shelves. How could this be? A world class library and I can't find a 
single thing to read? Close to giving up, I decided to look up one final book: 
[Flatland](http://www.amazon.com/Flatland-Romance-Dimensions-Thrift-Editions/dp/048627263X). 
It was available, but hidden away somewhere in the basement. Expecting more 
failure, we headed down.

We found ourselves in a large room with a dark red carpet, low ceilings 
with exposed pipes jutting out and sliding stacks. We followed the call number 
to the proper shelf and, to our great astonishment, the book was there!

Success! I was just about to head out when one of the pages caught my 
attention. I opened the book up to take a closer look and this is what I 
found:

Scribbles. I flipped the page and found more scribbles. I flipped through 
the whole thing and it was nothing but jagged lines. Every. Single. Page. At 
this point, I was sure that I had lost my mind. [Perchance to 
Dream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perchance_to_Dream_(Batman:_The_Animated_Series)) 
anyone?

Molly captured on camera the split second when I totally, utterly cracked. As 
it turns out, instead of the real Flatland by Edwin A. Abbott, I had stumbled 
across some modern art/poetry thing with the exact same title. The "author" 
explains on his [webpage](http://www.littleredleaves.com/LRL1/beaulieu.html):

> For each page of Abbott's novel I have traced, by hand, a 
> representation of each letter's occurrence across every page of text. The 
> generated result is a series of superimposed seismographic images which reduce 
> the text in question into a  two-dimensional schematic reminiscent of EKG 
> results or stock reports.

How the hell does this crap get published? Why did Stanford buy it? WHY? 

I left the library that day without a book and quite shaken by the experience. 
Fortunately, time heals all wounds. Time, and a nice bottle of wine.
