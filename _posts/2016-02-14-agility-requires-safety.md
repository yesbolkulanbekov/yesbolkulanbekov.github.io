To go faster in a car, you need not only a powerful engine, but also safety
mechanisms like brakes, air bags, and seat belts. This is a talk I did as part of
[NerdWallet's NerdTalks Series](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/corporate-news/nerdwallets-speaker-series-nerdtalks/)
where I discuss the safety mechanisms that allow you to build software faster.

*Update*: If you prefer reading to watching a talk, you can also check out the [Agility Requires Safety blog
post](http://themacro.com/articles/2016/03/agility-requires-safety/) I did on Y Combinator's The Macro. It has even
been translated to [Japanese](http://postd.cc/agility-requires-safety/)!
