This is a talk I gave at
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1634792553462138/" target="_blank">TechHub Riga</a>
that introduces the basic tools of user-centered and visual design.
It's targeted at developers and any other design newbies who want to improve
the design of their websites, mobile apps, resumes, slide decks, and so on.
Here are the video and slides:

It's a short talk, so I could only cover a small number of topics. For a more
in-depth look, including other aspects of product design such as market
research, MVPs, marketing, sales, and data-driven development, check out my book
[Hello, Startup]({{ site.hello_startup_url }}?ref=ybrikman-crash-course-design).
