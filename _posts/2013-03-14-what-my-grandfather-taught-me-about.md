*This is the eulogy I gave for my grandfather on March 14, 2013. He was 93 
years old.* 

I want to share with you something I learned 
from my grandfather. It may sound a bit odd at a time like this, but I want to 
tell you guys what I learned from him about happiness. 

Here's the thing: my grandfather had a tough life. He 
went through war, communism, poverty, emigration, and somehow, he came out the 
other end happy, kind, and loving. 

His happiness showed through in every conversation. For example, he spent over 20 years in the Red Army, 
and not by choice; his original plan had been to study history in college, but 
when WWII broke out, he was drafted. But if you asked him about it, the story 
he would tell would not be about the misery of military life, but rather about 
the life-long friends he made in the army and the discipline and strength he 
learned.

He fought in some of the biggest battles of World War 
II, including Stalingrad and Kursk, and was wounded several times. But if you 
ask him about that, he'd mostly smile as he told you about the pretty nurses 
he met while recovering from his wounds. He'd also tell you that he was 
wounded in the leg... though the photographs clearly show a bandage on his 
head... He'd just laugh about that too.

After fighting the Nazis for years across all of 
Europe, he ended up being part of the offensive that took Berlin. There is 
even a photo of him in front of the fallen Reichstag. Ask him about that and 
he'd tell you how much he enjoyed living in Berlin. With a German family. And 
how hospitable and friendly they were.

He lived through some of the toughest years of 
Communism in the Soviet Union, sometimes at near poverty levels in horrible 
communal apartments. But if you ask him about that, he'd tell you about his 
circle of friends, he'd go on about how Riga was beautiful, and he'd tell you 
about going to theater every night.

I found his attitude astonishing, but wonderful. Life 
was never easy for my grandfather, but he never complained. Whereas I freak 
out when my iPhone loses signal for a minute and I can't check my email; and 
then freak out again because I can't use twitter to complain about the signal 
loss. 

So what was his secret? 

I think my grandpa realized, perhaps subconsciously, 
that you can't just *be* happy. You can *be* tall or you can *be* fat or you 
can *be* strong, but happiness is different. Happiness is not something you 
*have*, it's something you *do*.

My grandfather was happy because he always focused on the things he loved. 
That's what he did. And when you do what you love, you do it well, and you'll 
be happy. For example, in the army, he was a medic. I cannot 
imagine the daily horrors and stress of a job like that. But my grandpa was 
able to focus on the parts he loved: learning medicine, helping people, and 
working with a team of doctors he admired. My grandpa became an excellent 
medic.

Later in life, in his 40's, he went to law school and 
began studying law. That's not an easy career change at that age, and not an 
easy job at any age. But he never complained; in fact, he'd always light up 
when talking about being an attorney, about the amazing people he got to work 
with, and the perks of the job&mdash;you could tell he *loved* it. It's no 
surprise he spent the next 30 years as a successful attorney. 

Now, this isn't just blind optimism; there is science behind it. There is 
[research](http://www.ted.com/talks/amy_cuddy_your_body_language_shapes_who_you_are.html) 
that indicates that if you just change your body language&mdash;force a smile on 
your face, assume an open, comfortable posture&mdash;after a few minutes, your 
cortisol levels drop, testosterone levels go up, and you feel better. You feel 
happier. 

It's also possible that how you react to events&mdash;in fact, the 
[very words you use to](http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20121026164951-101706366-change-your-words-change-your-life-the-simplest-tool-i-know-for-immediately-transforming-the-quality-of-your-life)
[think](http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20121026164951-101706366-change-your-words-change-your-life-the-simplest-tool-i-know-for-immediately-transforming-the-quality-of-your-life)
[about those events](http://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20121026164951-101706366-change-your-words-change-your-life-the-simplest-tool-i-know-for-immediately-transforming-the-quality-of-your-life)&mdash;has 
a dramatic effect on your mood. When something bad happens, some people 
react by starting to curse, yell, frown, shake their hands, complain... Other 
people just look around, nod, and say "that's... mildly inconvenient". And 
just like that, the entire problem doesn't seem so bad. 

It's counter-intuitive, but the *way* you think about things and your verbal 
and body language are not just a *reflection* of your emotions, but an active 
cause of those emotions. It's a two way street. 

By choosing to focus on the things you love, you 
aren't just *pretending* to be happy, you really are happy. My grandpa's happy 
memories of living in communist Riga or even post-war Berlin weren't 
delusions: they were genuine happiness.

Happiness is not something you have, it's something you *do*. This doesn't mean my grandfather totally blocked out 
all the bad memories. He wasn't in denial. Years ago, I was watching Saving 
Private Ryan, a violent WWII movie, and my grandfather, who never watched any 
American movies, happened to walk by the room and watched for a minute. After 
a drawn out battle scene, he said "I've seen this before... it's not that 
great", shrugged, and moved on. 

He remembered the war, both the good and the bad. But 
his reaction was of the "that's... mildly inconvenient" variety, which made 
the bad, even the awful, tolerable. And then, of course, he'd be able to focus 
on the good. In fact, he was proud of what he did in the war&mdash;we all were. V 
day was one of the most important days of the year for him and always called 
for a celebration.

My grandpa had other passions that made him 
happy. He loved to go on walks. Every day, even multiple times per day, rain 
or shine, he'd go out on a walk. Walks made him happy, or maybe being happy 
made him walk, but either way, he got good at it. He even walked the dogs of 
family friends, partially because he loved dogs and partially because dogs 
were the only ones that could keep up with him on a walk. 

He also loved a good conversation and became quite 
good at that too. Every family dinner would start with the a toast from my 
grandfather: he'd stand up, raise his glass, and inspire everyone with a few 
well thought out sentences. Sometimes he'd throw in a joke or even a poem. And 
he could talk to anyone. Language barriers didn't matter: Russian, Ukranian, 
German, Yiddish, even learning a little English at an old age. The language of 
kindness and a smile is universal. 

And of course, he loved his family. I think my mom 
turned out pretty well, as did the grandkids, so I guess he did a good job 
there too. I like to think we made him happy.

So, that's the secret. Happiness is not something you *have*, it's something 
you *do*. No matter what is happening in your life, 
actively focus on what you love and you'll be happy. I think on a day like 
today, this is more important than ever. 

So, as you remember my grandpa, do what he would have: 
remember the things that are good. Remember the stories he told you, the 
laughs you shared, and the amazing life he led. Better yet, share those 
stories with someone you love, while out on a nice, long walk.
