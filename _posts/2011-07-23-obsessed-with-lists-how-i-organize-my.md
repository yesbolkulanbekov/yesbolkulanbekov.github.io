A little while back, I wrote about my [obsession with the 
apocalypse](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2011/07/12/obsessed-with-apocalypse/). 
Today, I'm going to talk about a slightly different obsession: lists. To be 
honest, not many people see this side of me. However, it's a big part of who I 
am and how I get things done, and perhaps by sharing it, it'll help others. Or 
perhaps you'll realize I'm an OCD maniac and end up avoiding me in the 
hallways.

## Write down *everything*

I have long since accepted the fact that my memory is fallible and limited, so 
I tend to write down just about *everything*. Paper and digital media tend to 
be much more reliable and easier to search than my mind. As you'll see in the 
rest of this blog post, I keep lists for everything you can think of, from my 
agenda for the day, to the groceries I need to buy, to the books I want to 
read. 

A big part of making this an effective system is developing the discipline to 
(a) write down *everything*, as soon as possible and (b) strong 
search/organization skills so I can then find the relevant information in my 
many lists. When I get it right, I can very quickly access data from all 
aspects of my life in a matter of seconds. 

## Tools of the trade

One of the things I struggle with is picking the right tools for my many 
lists. I've tried a huge variety with varying degrees of success and am 
continuously on the lookout for better options&mdash;if you know of any, please 
let me know in the comments. I've found that with note &amp; list tools, there 
are a number of trade-offs to consider: speed, searchability, accessibility, 
price, support for sharing, and tuning for specific tasks. The rest of this 
blog post will be a list&mdash;go figure&mdash;of some of the tools that I currently 
use and their pros and cons. 

### Pen and Paper

{% include figure.html path="blog/lists/moleskine.jpg" alt="Pen and paper" %}

Even though I'm a die-hard technologist, I find that pen and paper is still 
the best choice in certain circumstances. In particular, for my  daily agenda, 
note taking, and shopping lists, I have not found a single digital device
that can compare in terms of speed &amp; efficiency. I had high hopes the 
[iPad](http://www.apple.com/ipad/)  would finally replace my notebook, but I 
found typing to be too clunky  (especially since I diagram and doodle a lot), 
finger drawing too  imprecise, and the whole device just a *little* too heavy, 
both  physically and in terms of UI. Perhaps a stylus and a well tuned app 
would  do the trick, but I haven't seen it yet. 

#### Pros

1. Lightning fast 
1. Good for writing and drawing 

#### Cons 

1. Not searchable 
1. Hard to organize: post-it notes, tabs, and bookmarks are fairly clunky 
1. Not easily sharable 
1. Easily lost 
1. Not always available ("doh, I left it at the office!") 

#### Use cases

1. **Daily agenda**: a short list of items I plan on getting done for the 
day. 
1. **Note taking**: I have not found anything that can match pen and paper 
when taking notes while listening to a live speaker or presentation. 
1. **Grocery list**: another short list that I put together in a hurry and 
then dispose of. 

### Google Docs

{% include figure.html path="blog/lists/google-docs.png" caption="Google Docs" url="http://docs.google.com" %}

Text documents, spreadsheets, presentations and drawings in the cloud. For 
free. This is my weapon of choice for the VAST majority of things that don't 
need quite the speed of pen &amp; paper. I keep so much info in Google Docs at 
this point that I'd be in a lot of trouble if anything ever happened to the 
service. 

#### Pros

1. Accessible everywhere you have the internet&mdash;even editable on a smartphone! 
1. Searchable 
1. Easy to organize using tags/folders 
1. Easy to share and collaborate 

#### Cons

1. Not quite as fast as pen and paper, especially for quick sketches 

#### Use cases

1. **Packing lists**: I create a new list for each trip I take, no matter 
how short or long. Creating a new one is a snap nowadays, as I just copy &amp; 
paste from a few existing ones and tweak as necessary. 
1. **Travel TODO's**: I keep a list of all the places I want to travel and 
slowly check things off as I get them done. 
1. **Idea list**: all the ideas I come up with for side projects and 
hackdays go into a google doc. I have over 200 ideas written down now, many of 
which I've actually built, such as [Resume 
Builder](http://resume.linkedinlabs.com/). 
1. **Writing list**: a list of things I want to write about, either in my 
blog or the occasional short story in my spare time. 
1. **What I did at work**: every project I do at work gets added to this 
list. Very useful when the annual review process rolls around, as I can just 
grab the list and put it straight into my self-evaluation. Also handy for 
updating my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/jbrikman). 
1. **Project TODO lists**: for each long-term project, I keep a list of 
tasks that I need to get done. For example, I have one for the [LinkedIn 
Engineering Blog](http://engineering.linkedin.com/) so I can keep track of 
posts I need to put up and another one for the [Intern 
Hackday](http://hackday2011.linkedin.com/) site to make sure to add the 
necessary features as the competition draws closer. 
1. **Long term notes**: if I have notes that I need to reference for more 
than a few days, pen &amp; paper no longer suffice. I transfer them into a 
google doc, paying the penalty of time, but gaining the assurance that I'll 
always be able to find the notes when I need them. 
1. **Workout schedule**: I take workouts from the [Crossfit 
mainsite](http://crossfit.com/), [Crossfit 
Football](http://www.crossfitfootball.com/) and [Crossfit 
Endurance](http://www.crossfitendurance.com/) and plug them into a schedule 
that's customized for the extra strength training I do and the equipment I'll 
have available that day (ie, whether I'll be at [Crossfit 
Sunnyvale](http://crossfitsunnyvale.com/) or just doing something on a 
football field). 
1. **Recipes**: every time I learn to cook something new and complicated, I 
write it down. Most recently, I learned to make 
[borscht](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borscht)! 
1. **Travel itineraries**: for planning and organizing trips. 
1. **Car information**: last time I had an oil change, inspections, VIN, 
license plate number, year, etc. 

### Evernote

{% include figure.html path="blog/lists/evernote.gif" caption="Evernote" url="https://evernote.com/" %}

An app specifically for taking notes. Has a nice web interface, iPhone app, and 
browser plugins. Very popular and well supported.

#### Pros

1. Custom-built for notes, so its faster than Google Docs for writing down quick thoughts
1. Searchable
1. Accessible on a wide variety of devices 
1. Easy to organize and collaborate

#### Cons

1. Still not as fast for note taking as pen and paper
1. Primarily built for notes, so you probably wouldn't want to use it for longer
documents

#### Use cases

1. **Storing bookmarks**: I bookmark anything I might want later&mdash; 
primarily software tools and guides&mdash;and tag it. For example, the [3 web 
development 
tools](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2011/07/16/3-web-development-tools-youve-probably/) 
and [3 more web development 
tools](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2011/07/21/3-more-web-development-tools-youve/) 
blog posts were created by just going into Evernote and browsing to my "developer
bookmarks" tag.
1. **Storing important notes**: when you're taking notes that you will need to 
reference, search, and share often, the extra friction of using Evernote over
pen and paper can be worth it.

### GoodReads

{% include figure.html path="blog/lists/goodreads-logo.jpg" caption="GoodReads" url="https://www.goodreads.com/" %}

A service built specifically to help you build a collection of books, both 
those you've already read (and optionally reviewed) as well as those you want 
to read. I _love_ GoodReads. Every time a friend says, "hey, you should really 
read XXX", instead of forgetting about it 5 minutes later, I toss it into 
my GoodReads "to read" list. Every time I'm bored, I go through this list and
always have something interesting to check out.

#### Pros

1. Huge database of books 
1. Lots of authors seem to use the site (including <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/13496405.Yevgeniy_Brikman">me</a>!)
1. Good reviews and ratings from members
1. UI well tuned for tracking books 
1. Lists and recommendation system are a great way to find new books to read
1. Web and mobile apps

#### Cons

1. Not too many of my friends are using it 
1. Slow website

#### Use cases

1.  **Tracking books**: reviews, to-read lists 

### Google calendar

{% include figure.html path="blog/lists/google-calendar.jpg" caption="Google Calendar" url="https://www.google.com/calendar" %}

Not exactly a list, but I couldn't talk about keeping my life organized 
without mentioning Google Calendar. In the same way that gmail is vastly 
superior to every email client ever built by Microsoft or Apple, Google 
Calendar is head and shoulders above Exchange, Outlook, iCal, etc. All my 
other calendars feed into it. My phone is synced to it. My life revolves 
around it. 

#### Pros

1. Clean, easy to use UI 
1. Very flexible reminders/alerts 
1. Accessible from any browser and my iPhone 

#### Cons

1. We still use exchange at work for some reason 

#### Use cases

1. **Scheduling**: if it's not on my calendar, I won't be there.
