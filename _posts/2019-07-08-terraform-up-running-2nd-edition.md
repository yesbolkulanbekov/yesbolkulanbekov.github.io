Today, I have two exciting announcements to share:

1. Weâ€™ve updated the [Comprehensive Guide to 
   Terraform](https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-terraform-b3d32832baca#.j3aj4mynb) blog post series 
   all the way through Terraform 0.12!
1. The [Early Release of the 2nd edition of Terraform: Up & 
   Running](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/terraform-up/9781492046899/) is now available! The 2nd edition of 
   the book is nearly double the length of the 1st edition (~160 more pages), and it has been fully updated through 
   Terraform 0.12, including two completely new chapters: Production-grade Terraform Code and How to Test Terraform 
   Code.

Check out the following blog posts to learn what has changed in the Terraform world in the last 2 years by going over
