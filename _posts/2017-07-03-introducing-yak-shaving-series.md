Yak shaving is a wonderful expression that refers to a long series of steps you have to take care of before you can do 
the actual task you set out to do. At Gruntwork, we do a lot of Yak shaving, and we hope by sharing these stories, we
can provide some entertainment, education, and stress relief.
