In one week, my girlfriend and I will be leaving California. We've [sold just
about everything we own](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2015/06/02/moving-to-italy-digital-garage-sale/).
Our remaining earthly possessions fit into the back of my Corolla, which we'll 
be taking on a [cross-country road trip](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Menlo+Park,+CA/Lake+Tahoe/Bonneville+Salt+Flats/Craters+of+the+Moon+National+Monument+%26+Preserve,+Arco,+ID/Hell%27s+Half+Acre+Lava+Field/Grand+Teton+National+Park,+Wyoming/Yellowstone+National+Park/Devils+Tower+National+Monument,+Wyoming/Deadwood,+SD/Mount+Rushmore+National+Memorial,+13000+S+Dakota+244,+Keystone,+SD+57751/Badlands+National+Park,+South+Dakota/Sioux+Falls,+SD/Chicago,+IL/Cleveland,+OH/Niagara+Falls,+NY/Cornell+University/Marblehead,+MA+01945/). 
A few weeks after that, we move to Italy. Molly will be starting her postdoc 
at the [European University Institute](http://www.eui.eu/Home.aspx) in Florence 
and I will be starting... Well, that's a story for a different time.

It's a little bittersweet. On the one hand, "moving to Italy" is one of those 
crazy things people say, but never actually do. Except we're going to do it. 
When else in our lives are we going to get a chance to [live in a villa in Tuscany](http://www.independenttraveler.com/destinations/europe/italy#tuscany),
[train like a gladiator in Rome](http://www.independenttraveler.com/destinations/europe/italy#rome),
[learn to make pizza in Sorrento](http://www.independenttraveler.com/destinations/europe/italy#sorrento),
[go hiking in the Dolomites](http://www.nationalgeographicexpeditions.com/expeditions/italy-dolomite-tour/detail),
or go [biking in Crete Senesi](https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=crete%20senesi)?

On the other hand, the last 6 years in California have been life-changing. 
Before I moved here, I had no inkling of what this place was really like. I had 
heard of Silicon Valley, sure, but I assumed it was just a bunch of hype. I was 
wrong. If you're into programming, or startups, or technology, there is no 
better place to be in the world. Here, you're not a weirdo or a nerd. Well, you 
are, but so is everyone else. Something magical happens when a single place has 
such a critical density of brilliant people, know-how, and money. There is 
constant excitement about new products, new companies, and new technologies. 
Or, as Box CEO Aaron Levie put it:

There are meetup groups, classes, lectures, conferences, clubs, and outings for 
every interest. And speaking of outings, the weather is incredible, and you are 
surrounded by gorgeous works of nature anywhere you go. [Scenic drives](https://plus.google.com/photos/+YevgeniyBrikman/albums/6065155864957334193),
[giant trees](https://plus.google.com/photos/+YevgeniyBrikman/albums/6065163523436693137),

[waterfalls](https://plus.google.com/photos/+YevgeniyBrikman/albums/5784183535063467265),
[flower gardens](https://plus.google.com/photos/+YevgeniyBrikman/albums/6006155842718993409),
and [national parks](https://plus.google.com/photos/+YevgeniyBrikman/albums/6148951852501873889)
are all just a few hours away.

California, and the people here, you have been very good to us. Thank you for
these incredible last 6 years. We're going to miss you.

I leave you with some photos that capture a few of the highlights from our
California adventure.
