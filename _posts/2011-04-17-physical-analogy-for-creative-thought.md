As a software engineer, I tend to be very methodical in my thinking. I 
approach every problem by breaking it down into discrete pieces, analyzing 
each one in a logical fashion, and following a series of coherent steps to a 
solution. It's easy for me to picture my conscious, problem-solving mind as a 
some sort of geared device, a Rube Goldberg machine, or even a computer 
applying an algorithm. 

But what about creative thinking? What about moments of inspiration? You're 
sitting on the can and WHAM, out of nowhere, an idea hits you. There was no 
conscious thought process, no gears turning, nothing visible happening. It's 
as if creativity happens behind a curtain and when the process completes, your 
unconscious hands you an answer. What physical analogy could explain what 
happens behind this "curtain"?

When it comes to creativity, the analogy of gears and machines seems largely 
unsatisfying, failing to provide an explanation for both (a) the random and 
unpredictable aspects of creative thinking, such as how answers and ideas can 
just appear at any time or place and (b) the more deterministic trends, such 
as some people consistently being more creative than others and some 
situations fostering more creativity than others. Rather appropriately, a 
possible solution to this problem came to me in a moment of inspiration: 
seemingly out of nowhere, I started to think about coin flips, index cards and 
an interesting analogy came to mind. 

## Creative thinking as a deck of index cards 

Imagine that you have a deck of index cards and that each card has a word or 
phrase on it. These cards represent the ideas and thoughts that are floating 
in your head. The creative thought process can then be seen as:

1. Shuffle the index cards. 
1. Drop them on the floor. 
1. Scan over the cards and see what sentences have formed from the random 
arrangement of words. 

Most of the time, the random permutations of words will be meaningless. You 
just have to pick up the cards and return to step 1. However, every now and 
then, a meaningful sentence or thought will emerge. Sometimes this will be a 
full solution to a problem - the "aha!" moment; other times, this will be a 
mere stepping stone from which you gather enough info to add or remove index 
cards from your deck before returning to step 1. 

## What I like about this analogy 

{% include image.html path="blog/creativity/cards.jpg" alt="Index cards" %}

1. It cleanly explains the unpredictability of the creative thought process 
without resorting to any magical or divine reasoning. Sometimes the cards fall 
the way you want, sometimes they don't. 
1. The particular choice of cards in your deck and the way you adjust them 
with each iteration is a great model for why your creativity may "click" for 
some problems and not for others. For example, consider "[linguistic 
equations](http://www.intelligence-test.net/part1/)" or 
"[DITLOIDS](http://www.blackstump.com.au/ditloid.htm)" style puzzles 
(warning: these links are highly addictive). Most people are able to solve a 
few very quickly, but get stuck  on the rest for a long time. This could be 
seen as the natural outcome of which index cards you pull into your deck as 
you read each problem. For example, when you see the number 26, there are  
very few concepts - and consequently index cards - that you would associate 
with that number. The size of the deck is small and it only takes a few trials 
before a meaningful answer emerges. On the other hand, a number  like 3 has 
MANY possibilities, resulting in many more cards in the deck and consequently 
many more iterations before you stumble upon the proper permutation. 
1. We can also explain why, even when faced with the same types of problems, 
you creativity may fluctuate by considering the possibility that not all the 
possible "index cards" of your mind are equally accessible. Depending on what 
you've been doing and thinking about, some words/phrases will be top of mind 
and readily pulled into your deck; other cards will represent concepts you 
haven't considered in a long time, stashed in the deep recesses of your 
memory, and will rarely get pulled into a deck. 
1. I've always find that increased constraints lead to increased creativity. 
If I'm trying to solve too big or vague of a problem, I actually find it 
harder to come up with ideas than when faced with a smaller and more clearly 
defined problem. Again, the card analogy works here: broad and vague problems 
would be pulling in cards from all over your mind. These would represent 
totally unrelated thoughts and ideas and result in permutations that are 
completely meaningless. On the other hand, more constrained problems would 
result in pulling in cards that are closely related and consequently, much 
more likely to form coherent thoughts when they land next to each other. 
1. Finally, the index card system has several tuning points that could account 
for the creativity differences between people. This could result from varying 
values in the total number of cards available, the number of iterations per 
unit time the person can do, the ability to scan cards after each iteration 
and recognize that a permutation has meaning or value, the skill of picking 
which cards to put into the deck initially and the ability to adjust the cards 
in the deck after each iteration.

## Vegas?

If this analogy were true, it would suggest that the brain uses a [Las Vegas 
Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas_algorithm) for creative 
thinking. This may also help explain why brainstorming sessions can be an 
effective way to get creativity going: they are a conscious way to pull in 
ideas and try all sorts of permutations until, hopefully, a useful one 
emerges. Einstein may have refused the idea that God would play dice, but 
perhaps, behind the curtain of our unconscious, we are just playing cards.
