A terrific technical achievement that's well worth your time, but 
somehow falls short of greatness. 

\+ Superb graphics  
\+ Some unique weapons  
\+ Nice cover system...  
\- ... that becomes very repetitive  
\- Odd stylistic choices  
\- Impotent guns  
\- Extremely unstable  
\- Choppy performance  

## Introduction:  

{% include figure.html path="blog/thumbs/gears-of-war.png" alt="Gears of War" %}

I found [Gears of War](http://gearsofwar.com/) a bit difficult to review. On 
the one hand, it gets so much right and truly brings something unique to the 
table. The game looks phenomenal, the cover system adds a new wrinkle on 
typical shooter gameplay and at times, the game feels like a sci-fi movie. On 
the other hand, the game experience can feel very repetitive and shallow. This 
game has gotten high praises from tons of [game 
sites](http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/gearsofwar/review.html) and is 
without a doubt worth a try, but I wouldn't put it anywhere near the list of 
greatest games of all time. 

Let's break it down. 

## Graphics:  9.5/10

The GoW graphics engine (Unreal 3 engine, I believe) is excellent. The player 
models are extremely detailed, the lighting is top notch, there are high 
resolution textures everywhere, explosions look amazing and various special 
effects (HDR, blur) are used effectively. The game also gets massive credit 
for pulling off a flawless 3rd-person camera. 

## Artistic Design:  7.0/10 

This is an area where GoW is much more uneven. The game shows some great 
attention to detail: the "shaky cam" when running, the brutal chainsaw 
animation, the even more brutal curb stomp, and the hammer of dawn are all 
unique and undoubtedly impressive. But I just can't stand some of the 
stylistic choices: most of the game settings are the same drab, boring color; 
all the (biped) characters in the game wear giant, ridiculous looking boots 
that must weigh 50lbs a piece; despite wearing armor on almost all of their 
body, in typical Unreal fashion, they don't wear a helmet; the tremendous 
overuse of HDR/soft light that makes everything look soft &amp; washed out; 
the list goes on. While you can see the tremendous potential of the graphics 
engine, many of the stylistic choices really disappoint. 

## Sound: 8.0/10 

The music in the game is reasonably well done, and the voice acting is pretty 
good. However, I found the sound effects to be more of a mixed bag. Most of 
the bad guys, for example, make the same stupid screaming/grunting noise every 
time they appear. Many of the guns don't have any real "boom" to them - they 
just sound like like a piece of paper stuck in a fan. Combined with the 
impotency of many of the guns (see the gamplay section below), you sometimes 
feel like you're firing spitballs. 

## Plot:  5.0/10 

A completely generic, throw away plot. The focus of the game is definitely the 
action, not the story telling. 

## Level Design:  8/10 

The majority of the game follows a very simple level design strategy: you walk 
into a room or outdoor area with scattered stone slabs/furniture/walls/etc. 
You hide behind these obstacles and pop out briefly to kill the enemies until 
the room is cleared. Then you move on. This cover system is pretty amusing 
initially but gets repetitive very quickly. Fortunately, GoW does toss in a 
reasonable number of unique set pieces that change up the pace. It's a good 
thing too, as the game is completely linear, so you definitely need the 
variety to break up the monotony of the cover system. You'll fight several 
types of enemies that are impervious to bullets, all of which require 
alternative strategies to defeat. 

## Gameplay:  6/10 

At its core, the game is entirely focused on hiding behind obstacles, popping 
out to shoot and hiding again, repeat over and over until a room is clear. If 
you try running around in the open, you are often killed very quickly, so you 
have lots of incentive to stay well hidden. The cover system works well and 
definitely adds a unique flavor to the combat. However, it becomes boring in a 
surprisingly short time. The level design is already linear, so being forced 
into this repetitive mechanic can get monotonous real quick. One other gripe 
is that the game uses the same button to (1) take cover (2) sprint (3) perform 
acrobatic maneuvers (4) jump over obstacles. The result is that you often end 
up performing the wrong action at the wrong time, such as jumping for cover on 
the wrong side of a wall when you were actually trying to sprint around to the 
other side. 

You have the typical shooter weapons at your disposal - machine gun, hand gun, 
shotgun, rocket launcher, sniper rifle - but all of them tend to be very 
underwhelming. There's really no way around it: most of the guns in the game 
are WEAK. On any difficulty setting above the easiest, you'll empty almost a 
clip of ammo to take down a typical grunt. It gets better if you go for 
headshots or take out their knees, but the fact that even the basic grunts 
take multiple hits to the head is still ridiculous. Some of the smaller bosses 
in the game that you'll encounter frequently can take a stupid number of 
headshots from the sniper rifle to their helmet-less heads, which is a 
mechanic few previous games would dare to ignore. 

To pussify the guns even more, it's interesting to consider the weapons in GoW 
that *do* allow one hit kills. One of these is the chainsaw - yup, a good old 
chainsaw can cut through armor far better than a futuristic gun. Another 
lethal weapon is the crossbow, which fires explosive arrows. That's right, the 
arrows on the crossbow are even better than the *grenade launcher*. The game 
also features an active reload system, where if you time reloads just right, 
it makes your gun more powerful. Huh? Is the guy putting in the bullets 
backwards the rest of the time? Finally, to add insult to injury, hitting a 
baddie with the butt end of a rifle is often a 1 hit kill. You heard me 
correctly: the *butt end of the rifle is more deadly than the bullets it 
fires*. It's nothing short of ridiculous. 

Fortunately, the game does offer some motivation to play it all the way 
through. On the Xbox 360, the ability to easily play through the whole game in 
coop mode adds a LOT to the experience. Some of the levels involve set pieces 
that are quite different from the standard cover &amp; shoot mechanic and can 
be truly heart pumping. But in the end, the game feels oddly stale and 
unsatisfying. 

## Length:  8/10 

As far as shooters go, especially those with such high production values, the 
single player is reasonably long, lasting around 12 hours. 

## Stability/Bugs:  4/10 

While the game works flawlessly on the Xbox 360, it can be a nightmare to get 
it running for many PC users. Issues include (1) crash to desktop when the 
game launches, (2) crash to desktop after a couple minutes of play, (3) crash 
to desktop at specific points in the game and (4) massive amounts of 
stuttering. I personally struggled with #2 and #4. The former prevented me 
from playing the game until I found a workaround on the [Gears of War 
Forums](http://gearsforums.epicgames.com/). The latter plagued my entire game 
experience, despite the fact that my hardware (see below) should have been 
able to handle the game fine. In fact, most of the game ran at a terrific 
framerate, but typically after a level loaded, and at random other points in 
the game, I would be watching a slideshow. 

## Performance:  4/10 

As explained in the section above, the game stuttered like crazy on my system. 
In fact, the stuttering was identical at 1280x800 medium settings as it was at 
1680x1050 high settings, so I ran with the latter. My computer: 

* AMD X2 3800+ 
* 2GB RAM 
* ATI x1900xtx 
* WinXP SP2 

## Overall:  7.5/10 

I really wanted to like this game. It looks beautiful and is full of 
meticulous detail. However, the gameplay, some of the design decisions and the 
technical issues really diminish the game in my eyes. It's still worth 
checking out, but with a few tweaks here and there, it could've truly been 
great. 

## Additional Notes  

I did not test (nor review) the multiplayer of this game.
