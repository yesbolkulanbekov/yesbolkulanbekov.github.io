To paraphrase Bill Gates, most people overestimate what they can do in a day
and underestimate what they can do in a year. I definitely underestimated my
2015 and found it rewarding to go back and realize just how much happened. I
published a [book](https://www.hello-startup.net/). I moved to
[Italy](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2015/07/08/from-california-to-italy/).
I started a [company](https://www.atomic-squirrel.net/). I did a lot of
[traveling](https://www.ybrikman.com/photos/). And a whole lot more:

Happy new year!
