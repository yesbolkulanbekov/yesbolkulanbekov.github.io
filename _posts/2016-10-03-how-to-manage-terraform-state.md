*Update: I took this blog post series, expanded it, and turned it into a book called 
[Terraform: Up & Running]({{ site.terraform_up_and_running_url }}?ref=ybrikman-blog-comprehensive-series)!*

In Part 1 of the [Comprehensive Guide to
Terraform](https://blog.gruntwork.io/a-comprehensive-guide-to-terraform-b3d32832baca?source=latest) series, we
explained [why we picked Terraform as our IAC tool of choice and not Chef, Puppet, Ansible, SaltStack, or
CloudFormation](https://blog.gruntwork.io/why-we-use-terraform-and-not-chef-puppet-ansible-saltstack-or-cloudformation-7989dad2865c?source=latest).
In Part 2 of the series, weÂ [introduced the basics of
Terraform](https://blog.gruntwork.io/an-introduction-to-terraform-f17df9c6d180) in a step-by-step tutorial
that showed how to deploy a cluster of web servers and a load balancer on AWS. In this post, we discuss

The way Terraform manages state has a profound impact on file layout, isolation, and locking, so this is a must-read
for anyone working on a Terraform project.
