I love a good tech talk. I like to watch them, I like to [give 
them](https://ybrikman.com/speaking), and now that I have lots of [free time 
on my hands](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2014/04/02/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-t-shirts/), 
I've put together a list of the must-see talks for every programmer. In this 
list, I've avoided language or library specific talks and instead focused on 
high-level, general topics that apply to everyone: 

1. [The future of technology](#future-tech) 
1. [User interface](#ui) 
1. [Programming language design](#lang-design) 
1. [Software engineering](#sw-eng) 
1. [Computers and learning](#learning) 
1. [A career in programming](#career) 
1. [Computer gaming](#gaming) 
1. [Fun talks](#fun) 

If I missed a talk you love, leave a comment. Happy watching!

## The future of technology

  <figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTAghAJcO1o">The Future Doesn't Have To Be Incremental</a> by Alan Kay</figcaption>
</figure>

When thinking about the future, you can't do better than [Alan 
Kay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay). In [The Future Doesn't Have To Be 
Incremental](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTAghAJcO1o), Kay describes how 
Xerox PARC was able to develop so many new technologies in such a short time, 
including the personal computer, bitmap displays, GUI, desktop publishing, 
word processing, laser printing, Ethernet, and object oriented programming. 
The key was a culture focused on invention - that is, fundamentally new 
research - instead of incremental innovation. Invention requires a 
significantly higher investment of money, much longer time frames, and a 
different approach to problem solving ("wouldn't it be ridiculous if in 30 
years we didn't have..."). 

Other essential talks on the future of technology:

1. [The Mother of All Demos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY) by 
Douglas Engelbart. A demonstration of hypertext, graphics, video conferencing, 
the mouse, word processing, and much more - all in 1968! This is the kind of 
leap frog invention Kay is referring to. 
1. [The Future of Programming](http://worrydream.com/dbx/) by Bret Victor. A 
brilliant talk where Bret Victor takes us back in time and reminds us that 
"the most dangerous thought that you can have as a creative person is to think 
that you know what you're doing. Because once you think you know what you're 
doing you stop looking around for other ways of doing things and you stop 
being able to see other ways of doing things. You become blind." 
1. [The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened 
Yet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKg1hTOQXoY) by Alan Kay. "I made up the 
term object-oriented and I can tell you I didn't have C++ in mind." 

<a name="ui"></a>

## User Interface

<figure>
  {% include iframe.html url="//player.vimeo.com/video/36579366?byline=0" %}
  <figcaption><a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366">Inventing on Principle</a> by Bret Victor</figcaption>
</figure>

[Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/)'s talk [Inventing on 
Principle](http://vimeo.com/36579366) will make all of your programming 
languages and tools feel obsolete. He presents a new way to write code: a user 
interface that makes the computer do the tedious work so that you can 
*experiment with and* *react* to your code instead of trying to simulate it in 
your head. This not only makes it much easier to learn programming, it 
fundamentally changes how we go about solving problems.

More UI goodness:

1. [Stop Drawing Dead Fish](http://vimeo.com/64895205) by Bret Victor. Using computers 
to bring art to life. 
1. [Media Thinking for the Unthinkable](http://vimeo.com/67076984) by Bret 
Victor. Designing a new medium for science and engineering. 
1. [Doing With Images Makes 
Symbols](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kzDpfk8YhlE) by Alan Kay. How humans 
learn and how to build user interfaces that support it. "The parts of the body 
you want to have learn don't understand English." 

<a name="lang-design"></a>

## Programming language design

{% include figure.html path="blog/tech-talks/simple-made-easy.png" caption="Simple Made Easy by Rich Hickey" url="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy" %}

[Rich Hickey](https://twitter.com/richhickey), the creator of 
[Clojure](http://clojure.org/), has the ability to make you see basic concepts 
in computer science in a whole new light. Complexity is one of these basic 
concepts and [Simple Made 
Easy](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) defines some of the 
best tools - the best language - to reason about it. 

A few other talks to add to your playlist: 

1. [Are We There Yet?](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey) by Rich 
Hickey. Another foundational talk by Hickey that will force you to reconsider 
state, time, identity, values, and types. 
1. [Growing a Language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0) by Guy 
Steele. One of the most clever presentations I've ever seen on programming 
language design. Give it about 10 minutes - the payoff is amazing. 
1. [The Science of Insecurity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kEfedtQVOY) by 
Meredith Patterson. Why current systems and protocols are inherently insecure 
and how to fix that in the future. 

<a name="sw-eng"></a>

## Software Engineering

<figure>
  {% include iframe.html url="https://player.vimeo.com/video/9270320?byline=0&portrait=0" %}
  <figcaption><a href="http://vimeo.com/9270320">What We Actually Know About Software Development, and Why We Believe It's True</a> by Greg Wilson</figcaption>
</figure>

[Greg Wilson](http://third-bit.com/) will force you to look closely at 
how you make decisions in software engineering: should you use Java? Ruby? 
Play Framework? Rails? TDD? Agile? Code reviews? Most of your answers are 
probably based solely on opinions, memes, trends, and anecdotes. [What We 
Actually Know About Software Development, and Why We Believe It's 
True](http://vimeo.com/9270320) is an important call to change our practices 
and move to a world of evidence-based software engineering. 

Other great talks: 

1. [Real Software Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP9AIUT9nos) by 
Glenn Vanderburg. Software engineering as it's taught in universities simply 
doesn't work. It doesn't produce software systems of high quality, and it 
doesn't produce them for low cost. Sometimes, even when practiced rigorously, 
it doesn't produce systems at all. 
1. [Hammock Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc) 
by Rich Hickey. "Most of the biggest problems in software are problems of 
misconception." To solve hard problems, step away from the computer, take some 
time to think, and [write it 
down](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2014/05/05/you-are-what-you-document/). 
1. [The Language of the System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROor6_NGIWU) 
by Rich Hickey. We focus extensively on the perfect programming language to 
build a single system, but what about languages for how multiple systems 
communicate with each other? 

<a name="learning"></a>

## Computers and Learning

<figure>
  {% include iframe.html url="//www.youtube.com/embed/U6FvJ6jMGHU" %}
  <figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6FvJ6jMGHU">What we're learning from online education</a> by Daphne Koller </figcaption>
</figure>

[Daphne Koller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daphne_Koller) and [Andrew 
Ng](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) are trying to reinvent education. 
They created [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), which offers real 
university classes, online and for free, to anyone in the world. [What we're 
learning from online education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6FvJ6jMGHU) 
talks about some of the techniques they are using to run classes of hundreds 
of thousands of students - including video, discussion forums, interactive 
UI's, automatic grading, and peer grading - and how this experiment is giving 
us unprecedented insight into how humans learn. 

A few other powerful talks on education: 

1. [Let's use video to reinvent education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTFEUsudhfs) by Salman Khan. 
Whereas Koller's talk is about university classes, Khan's talk is about online 
education for K-12 via the [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/). 
1. [Teaching Creative Computer 
Science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia55clAtdMs) by Simon Peyton Jones. 
Every child should learn computer science because it [teaches them a new way 
of thinking](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2014/05/19/dont-learn-to-code-learn-to-think/). 
1. [Machine Learning, A Love 
Story](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Machine-Learning) by Hilary Mason. 
The talks above are about teaching people; this talk is about teaching 
computers. 

<a name="career"></a>

## A Career in Programming

<figure>
  {% include iframe.html url="//www.youtube.com/embed/a1zDuOPkMSw" %}
  <figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw">You and Your Research</a> by Richard Hamming</figcaption>
</figure>

[You and Your Research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1zDuOPkMSw) is the 
blueprint for a successful career in any discipline, not just research; in 
fact, the talk has the nickname "You and Your Career". In this lecture, 
[Richard Hamming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming) shares his 
observations on "why do so few scientists make significant contributions and 
so many are forgotten in the long run?'' Some of the key ideas include 
courage, luck, drive ("knowledge and productivity are like compound 
interest"), a focus on important problems ("If you do not work on an important 
problem, it's unlikely you'll do important work"), open doors, selling the 
work ("I suggest that when you open a journal, as you turn the pages, you ask 
why you read some articles and not others"), and much more. This should be 
required viewing for every high school student. 

More talks on how to succeed in the programming industry: 

1. [The Myth of the Genius Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SARbwvhupQ) by Brian Fitzpatrick 
and Ben Collins-Sussman. This talk isn't about geniuses or [10x 
programmers](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2013/09/29/the-10x-developer-is-not-myth/), 
but rather, about building a culture that avoids elitism and provides support 
for personal growth, collaboration, and ideas. 
1. [Programming Well With Others: Social Skills for 
Geeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-7l8cnpI4k) by Brian Fitzpatrick and 
Ben Collins-Sussman. The Fitz and Ben duo are back to remind you that you need 
to learn more than just programming languages, compilers, debuggers, and 
algorithms to be a successful software engineer 
1. [JavaScript Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0TFmdO4ZP0) by 
Angelina Fabbro. Don't let the title fool you: this talk is a tutorial for how 
intermediate developers can become experts in any topic, not just JavaScript. 

<a name="gaming"></a>

## Computer Gaming

<figure>
  {% include iframe.html url="//www.youtube.com/embed/dE1DuBesGYM" %}
  <figcaption><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE1DuBesGYM">Gaming can make a better world</a> by Jane McGonigal</figcaption>
</figure>

By the time kids graduate high school, they have spent 10,000 hours playing 
games: this is roughly equivalent to the time they spend in school (if they 
had perfect attendance!) and the amount of [time it takes to become an 
expert](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)). What are they learning 
during those 10,000 hours? [Jane McGonigal](http://janemcgonigal.com/) will 
show you how this time and learning can be used to make a better world. 

More gaming goodness: 

1. [The game that can give you 10 extra years of 
life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfBpsV1Hwqs) by Jane McGonigal. A 
powerful talk by McGonigal about how games can improve our lives and how they 
helped her recover from suicidal depression following a severe concussion. 
1. [Human Computation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlzM3zcd-lk) by Luis 
von Ahn. We can use human brain power and gaming to solve problems that are 
difficult for computers, such as image recognition, translation, and "common 
sense". 
1. [Design Outside the 
Box](http://www.g4tv.com/videos/44277/dice-2010-design-outside-the-box-presentation/) 
by Jesse Schell. What happens when games invade every aspect of our lives.
