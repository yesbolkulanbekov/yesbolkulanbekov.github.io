I was watching Fight Club the other day for probably the 30th time and one 
particular scene really stuck with me. On a rainy night, Tyler Durden (Brad 
Pitt) is recklessly driving a car with the Narrator (Ed Norton) in the 
passenger seat and a few members of Project Mayhem in the back. As he steers 
the car into oncoming traffic and accelerates, Tyler asks: 

{% include figure.html path="blog/life-goals/fight-club.jpg" alt="Fight club" %}

> **Tyler**: Guys, what would you wish you'd done before you died?  
> **Ricky**: Paint a self-portrait.  
> **Mechanic**: Build a house.  
> **Tyler**: [to Narrator] And you?  
> **Narrator**: I don't know. Turn the wheel now, come on!  
> **Tyler**: You have to know the answer to this question! If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?  
> **Narrator**: I don't know, I wouldn't feel anything good about my life, is that what you want to hear me say? Fine. Come on!  
> **Tyler**: Not good enough.  

It occurred to me that, faced with the same question, I couldn't instantly 
come up with an answer. And that's sad. Although I painstakingly worked out my 
[fitness 
goals](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2010/01/06/my-2010-crossfit-goals/), I 
somehow had not done the same for any of my other goals. I routinely shake my 
head at people who head to the gym with no clear purpose defined, but to a 
large extent, I've gone about my whole life that way. I figured it was time 
for a change. 

## What would you wish you'd done before you died? 

1. Visit every continent. 
1. Sky dive. 
1. Write a book. 
1. Deadlift 500lbs. 
1. Run a 5 minute mile. 
1. Clean and Jerk 315lbs. 
1. Run 400m in 55 seconds. 
1. Do a planche push-up. 
1. Dunk a basketball. 
1. Do a backflip. 
1. Become a recognizable name in the software/CS field. 
1. Go into outer space and look down at the curvature of planet earth from above. 
1. Survive for one month like a caveman: that is, live alone in a forest with no modern technologies or comforts. 

So, that's it for now. Some of these goals I may accomplish within a year or 
two; others,  perhaps never at all. It doesn't matter, so long as I try.
