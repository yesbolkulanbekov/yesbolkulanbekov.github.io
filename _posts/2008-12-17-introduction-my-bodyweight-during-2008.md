My bodyweight during 2008: 

* 04/15: 223lbs 
* 05/24: 210lbs 
* 07/07: 200lbs 
* 08/28: 190lbs 
* 12/05: 180lbs 

That's 43lbs in less than 8 months (with a disproportionate 4 months spent on 
the last 10lbs). Was it the Atkins diet? South Beach diet? Zone diet? Broken 
bathroom scale? Did I just hack off a limb? 

Hell no. It was physics. Nah, seriously&mdash;my weight loss is 100% attributable 
to the law of conservation of energy. I wouldn't say the weight loss was 
*easy*&mdash;those last 10lbs in particular seemed to take forever&mdash;but it was 
surprisingly effortless. I ate any food that I wanted, I never felt hungry, I 
had tons of energy and my diet became a seamless part of my daily routine. All 
it took was following two basic rules: 

1. **Calories In &lt; Calories Out.** This is the *only* formula that really 
matters in weight management. Eat less than you burn and you are guaranteed to 
lose weight. 
1. **Maintain Lean Body Mass**. The weight you lose from following rule 
#1 will consist of not only fat, but muscle as well. Since the actual goal is 
to lower *body fat percentage*, it is essential to maintain as much of your 
lean body mass (LBM) as possible. 

Let's discuss these one at a time. 

## Rule 1: Calories In &lt; Calories Out 

This is *the* formula for weight loss. You can try every crazy diet on the 
planet, but if you eat more calories than you burn, you will NOT lose any 
significant amount of weight. As I said, it's basic physics: the human body 
requires some amount of energy X, measured in calories, to do its basic 
functions. Moving, thinking, breathing, walking, and just about everything you 
do requires energy, with the exact amount depending on a person's genetics, 
age, health, activity level, etc. The only two sources of energy readily 
available for the human body are the food you eat and** **the muscle/fat you 
already have. In general, your body will use the energy from food before it 
starts digesting the muscles/fat in your body. So, lets assume you eat Y 
calories per day and look at the 3 possibilities: 

1. Y &gt; X. Due to the law of conservation of energy, if you eat more 
calories than you burned, the calorie surplus (Y - X) has to go *somewhere*. 
In the human body, there are two main places for it to go: it gets turned into 
muscle or into fat. In either case, you gain weight. 
1. Y = X. If you ate and burned the same number of calories, there is no 
surplus or deficit to worry about, so you stay the same weight. 
1. Y &lt; X. Once again, due to that pesky law of conservation of energy, if 
you ate less calories then you burned, that deficit must come from 
*somewhere*. In the human body, the two main sources are muscles and fat. In 
either case, you lose weight. 

Eat less than you burn and you WILL lose weight. That's really all there 
is to it. Now, I know that I'm simplifying biology here, but on a large, 
week-to-week scale, this is a pretty accurate picture. 

## Ok, So How Do I Satisfy Rule #1? 

The first step is to start tracking how many calories you take in and how many 
you burn. Don't just try to guess or approximate, as you are all but 
guaranteed to get it wrong: after all, that's how you got fat in the first 
place. Instead, I highly recommend using a website like 
[thedailyplate.com](http://www.thedailyplate.com/) or 
[fitday.com](http://www.fitday.com/). They are free, have massive databases of 
foods with all the nutritional information, have all sorts of useful tools 
(like calorie calculators, graphs, weight tracker, etc) and take most of the 
guess work out of it. 

Log in, plug in your height, weight, age and activity level to get an 
approximation of your *basal metabolic rate.* This is how many calories you 
burn daily by just having a beating heart, eating, breathing, thinking - in 
short, existing. For the average 5'9", 175 pound male, merely being alive 
burns around 2000 calories per day. Any exercise or physical activity you do 
would add onto that. 

Once you have this figured out, start recording *every single item* you put in 
your mouth. You'd be surprised how quickly those little snacks can add up. 
Now, remember that ALL calorie tracking is an approximation. You will *never* 
know exactly how many calories are in that pastry or exactly how many calories 
you burned during your jog. Don't worry about it too much and just put down 
your best guess, using the estimates on the websites above as a base. For one 
thing, if you're honest about it, your errors - an overestimate here, an 
underestimate there - will often cancel each other out. Secondly, use a scale 
to track your weight: if your weight is going in the right direction, you're 
doing a good job of estimating. If your weight is not going in the right 
direction, even if you *think* you've been on a caloric deficit, don't just 
give up and assume the laws of physics do not apply to you. It just means that 
your estimates have been inaccurate (or incomplete). Keep at it, tweak your 
numbers, and eventually you'll get pretty damn good at it. Oh, and don't 
bother weighing yourself more than about once a week: your weight can 
fluctuate daily due to a number of unrelated reasons (water retention, 
weighing yourself at different times, etc), but over the longer term, these 
fluctuations tend to average out. 

## Rule 2: Maintain Lean Body Mass

Rule #1 only ensures that you will lose *weight*, which includes both fat 
and muscle. As it turns out, muscles are metabolically more "expensive" to 
maintain than fat - that is, it takes a lot of calories just to keep them 
around. If you are on a caloric deficit, your body may be very tempted to burn 
the muscle up for energy both to make up the energy deficit in the short term 
and to reduce the possible deficit in the future. However, losing weight at 
the cost of losing a lot of muscle mass is a **bad** idea for a number of 
reasons, including: 

1. Losing LBM lowers your basal metabolic rate, which is very 
counterproductive for dieting. If your basal metabolic rate is lower, you burn 
fewer calories per day. Therefore, to continue losing weight, you'd have to 
eat *even less*, which makes dieting even harder. If you continue losing 
muscle mass, you'll gradually see diminishing returns with your weight loss 
until your metabolism slows to a crawl, making weight loss virtually 
impossible. 
1. Obviously, losing muscle mass typically means performing worse at 
sports, struggling to move that couch, less energy through out the day, and so 
on. 
1. For the most part, a person's appearance - whether you have "toned" abs, 
firm thighs, cut shoulders, etc - is *much* more of a factor of body fat 
percentage than it is of total weight. You could lose a lot of weight, but if 
a large percentage of that weight loss is muscle, then your body fat 
percentage won't actually be that much lower. As a result, despite all your 
efforts, you won't necessarily look any better. Dieters who have had this 
happen have nicknamed it becoming "skinny fat" - you're much lighter, but 
still look just as flabby. 

Therefore, the main goal of a diet for most people should be not to lose 
weight, but to *lower body fat percentage*. 

## Lowering Body Fat Percentage 

There are only two ways to go about this: you either need to increase the 
amount of muscle in your body while keeping the amount of fat relatively 
constant ("bulking") or reduce the amount of fat in your body while keeping 
the amount of muscle relatively constant ("cutting"). To bulk, you must eat a 
caloric surplus and convince your body to turn the extra caloric energy into 
muscle mass. To cut, you must eat a caloric deficit and convince your body to 
get the missing caloric energy from your fat. Can you build muscle and lose 
fat at the same time? Not very effectively - see the FAQ below for more info. 

Since this post is about weight loss, our goal is to cut weight while 
maintaining as much muscle mass as possible. To do this, you need to convince 
your body that your metabolically expensive muscles are worth keeping around. 
Here are several good ways to do this: 

1. **Eat lots of protein**. This is absolutely essential. You need protein to 
build/maintain muscles, so make sure your body is *never* running short of it 
while on a caloric deficit. This is especially important if you are doing any 
sort of exercise. Try to eat around 1 gram of protein per pound of bodyweight: 
for example, if you weigh 175 lbs, try to eat 175 grams of protein per day. 
The same websites I mentioned for tracking calories automatically track 
protein intake as well. If this seems like a lot of protein, check out the FAQ 
section below for more info. 
2. **Weight training**. Consistently using your muscles to lift heavy weights 
is pretty much the single most effective way to tell your body that it should 
NOT digest its own muscles. In fact, it's pretty much the only way to keep the 
weight loss as close to 100% fat as possible. The most effective routines are 
those that work the entire body and focus on compound, low rep, heavy weight 
movements with free weights (e.g. [Starting 
Strength](http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Strength-2nd-Mark-Rippetoe/dp/0976805421), 
[Stronglifts 
5x5](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/), 
[Bill Starr 
5x5](http://www.geocities.com/elitemadcow1/5x5_Program/Linear_5x5.htm), 
[Crossfit](http://www.crossfit.com/)). Yes, even women should do weight 
training. NO, you will not get "big". Not only is it *extremely* difficult for 
the average woman to get "jacked", when you're on a calorie deficit, your 
primary concern will be trying not to *lose* muscle mass. Of course, doing 
weight training has many other benefits besides maintaining LBM, such as 
increased strength, increased sports performance, injury resistance, increased 
bone density, increased metabolism (helping accelerate future weight loss), 
improved balance and coordination, and so on. Despite the popular myth that 
weight training automatically makes you gain weight, I really can't stress 
enough how great of a tool it is when dieting. 
3. **Use a moderate caloric deficit**. If your caloric deficit is too 
big, your body will go more and more into a "starvation mode" where it'll 
digest a LOT of your muscle mass and actually try to conserve your fat for the 
future&mdash;the exact opposite of what you want. Therefore, don't go overboard 
with the caloric deficit: a daily deficit of 250 - 750 calories is reasonable 
range for most people and will let you lose about 0.5 - 1.5 lbs per week. Any 
more than that and a larger percentage of it will be muscle. 

## FAQ 

### What about other diets, like low fat diets, Atkins, Zone, South Beach, etc? 

If any of these fad diets works, it's simply because it tricks you into eating 
less calories than you burn. They all have various strategies for 
accomplishing this, but I personally prefer to skip to the heart of the issue 
and skip all the BS in between. In exchange, I get to decide what I eat, when 
I eat and how much, so long as I follow rules #1 and #2. 

### What foods should I avoid?

You can eat whatever you want, so long as you follow rules #1 and #2. *From a 
purely weight loss perspective*, it doesn't matter if all your calories come 
from eating nothing but candy dipped in melted butter. If you eat less 
calories than you burn, even if all the calories are from candy and butter, 
you WILL lose weight. Having said that, I'd take note of the following: 

1. Most people *should* be concerned with more than just their weight. For one 
thing, the need to keep your protein intake high (as in rule #2) will make it 
tough to live on a diet solely consisting of buttered candy. Secondly, your 
overall health relies not only on your weight or body fat percentage, but also 
on your diet's vitamin content, your blood cholesterol levels and many other 
diet-influenced factors. Each person should obviously consider these when 
deciding what to eat. So, while you *could* lose weight eating nothing but 
butter and candy, I wouldn't recommend it.
1. Staying within your caloric limit can be difficult without feeling hungry. 
You will find that some foods are a much better "bang for the buck" - that is, 
you can eat more of them and feel fuller without eating too many calories. The 
"[What does 200 calories look 
like?](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-does-200-calories-look-like.htm)" webpage 
does a great job of illustrating this. If you're staying within your caloric 
limit, you'll naturally find yourself gravitating towards foods towards the 
top of this page rather than the bottom, quite simply because you can eat more 
of them. As it happens, these calorie-sparse foods also happen to be the ones 
we traditionally consider "healthy". 


### What about macronutrient breakdown? Glycemic Index (GI)? 

From a weight loss perspective, both of these are relatively minor factors. As 
long as you're within your caloric limit, the body doesn't care all that much 
whether those calories came from carbs (whether high GI or low GI), fats or 
protein. The one exception is if your body fat percentage is already very 
low&mdash;below 10% for males&mdash;at which point losing more fat becomes much 
more challenging and every little detail must be monitored. However, the vast 
majority of people are nowhere near this level, so these are not particularly 
relevant. 

Having said that, I must again point out that from an overall health 
standpoint, you *may* want to be aware of these issues. Picking foods with a 
[lower Glycemic 
Index](http://www.diabetesnet.com/diabetes_food_diet/glycemic_index.php) can 
have many health benefits, such as reducing hunger, cholesterol and the risk 
of heart disease. A proper macronutrient breakdown, such as the 40-30-30 
(carbs-protein-fats) of the [Zone 
Diet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_diet), may help with hormone balance 
in the body, which can impact every aspect of your life, from mood to weight 
management. But as far as just losing weight, they probably aren't terribly 
important. 

I'd also note that, from personal experience, I have found that by picking 
foods that let me keep a caloric deficit and keeping my protein intake high 
(~1 gram per pound of bodyweight), both of these factors took care of 
themselves. I typically found that lower GI foods were also less calorie dense 
and I preferred them as I could eat them in larger quantities. Moreover, 
keeping my protein intake high naturally created a 40-30-30 macronutrient 
breakdown in my diet with no extra effort. 

### Should I eat many small meals per day?

If you keep caloric intake constant, eating multiple small meals a day versus 
several larger ones has no advantage as far as weight loss goes. In other 
words, the idea that eating more often raises your metabolism and somehow 
burns more calories is a myth. However, there are other benefits to eating 
more often that might make it worthwhile. The main one is that you can prevent 
yourself from getting hungry due to long breaks between meals, which can make 
it easier to stay within your caloric limits. 

### What about cardio? Should I exercise in the "fat burning zone"? What about HIIT? 

From a weight loss perspective, cardio is primarily an efficient way to burn 
more calories - to increase the "calories out" portion of the equation in rule 
#1. Of course, cardio has many other benefits that make it a very worthwhile 
activity that have little to do with weight loss. These include improved 
endurance, stronger heart and lungs, and improved blood cholesterol levels. 
Cardio activities can also help with maintaining LBM, but not nearly as 
effectively as weight training. 

As for the type of cardio, it's really up to you. There are studies that show 
that keeping your heart rate in the "fat burning zone" during cardio gives you 
the most favorable ratio of fat burned vs. muscle burned *while exercising*. 
Other people claim high intensity interval training (HIIT) is better. Whether 
or not they are right is, frankly, irrelevant. I really like this quote from 
Alan Aragon from an article about the "[afterburn 
effect](http://alwyncosgrove.blogspot.com/2008/02/what-is-afterburn-effect.html)": 

> Caring how much fat is burned during training makes as much sense 
> as caring how much muscle is built during training.

Perhaps you burn a slightly higher percentage of fat while in the "fat burning 
zone", but when you look at the big picture, this effect is pretty damn 
insignificant. All that really matters is how many calories you burned and 
from that perspective, you should just do *whatever cardio you enjoy and can 
do consistently*. 

### How do I get a 6 pack? Should I do crunches or sit-ups?

The first thing to understand is that having visible abs is, for all practical 
purposes, completely a factor of body fat percentage. If your body fat 
percentage is too high, it doesn't matter how many crunches you do, your abs 
will NOT be visible. You can buy the ab lounge, the bo-flex, and do crunches 
for days on end, but as long as there is a layer of fat over your abs, you 
won't be able to see them. 

The second thing to understand is that, realistically, the concept of "spot 
reduction" is a myth. By spot reduction, I mean the idea that by doing 
exercises on some specific part of your body, you can lose fat from just that 
place. The classic example is people doing sit-ups or crunches in the hope 
that this will reduce fat around their midsection. **It won't**. Sit-ups and 
crunches may make your abs stronger and boost their endurance, but they WILL 
NOT decrease fat specifically around your stomach. You could do a thousand 
reps on those goddamn [adductor 
machines](http://www.amazon.com/Inner-Thigh-Adductor-Machine-EA/dp/B0000AQKBT) 
at the gym and it won't magically burn fat off your ass or thighs. 

To be more specific, you will only lose fat&mdash;from any part of your body&mdash; 
when on a caloric deficit. *Where* the fat is lost from is entirely up to your 
body. You really don't have any say in the matter. If your body decides to 
lose a ton of weight from your stomach, but none from your thighs, there is 
nothing you can do about it. However, as a general rule, when you lose weight, 
you lose weight fairly evenly from all over your body. Having said that, most 
people tend to have a body part or two that keeps an disproportionally large 
amount of fat. For men, this is usually the stomach and love handles. For 
women, it's usually the thighs and butt. These parts of the body are usually 
the first ones to gain fat and the last ones to lose it. The *only* solution 
is to just keep doing what you are doing: once your body fat percentage gets 
low enough, you WILL lose fat from even these troublesome areas. 

### Is it possible to build muscle and lose fat at the same time? 

As I discussed before, muscle growth happens as a response to a caloric 
surplus while fat loss happens as a response to a caloric deficit. Although 
there are a few minor cases where both can happen, it should be obvious from 
the caloric formula alone that doing both at the same time isn't very 
feasible. It can be accomplished at a *very* slow rate by eating roughly 
"maintenance" calories (ie, calories in = calories out), but people typically 
have *much* better success (ie, achieve more muscle with less fat in a shorter 
time) by repeatedly alternating bulking and cutting cycles. 

It's also true that beginners to weight training, for a short while, can burn 
off fat and build muscle at the same time. This typically happens with 
overweight and completely untrained individuals, as their bodies are primed to 
use fat as fuel and their muscles, in total shock from the foreign stimulus of 
weight training, adapt very quickly ("beginner gains"). The result is that, 
for a few months after beginning weight training, many guys will see their 
waist lines shrink while their shoulders and legs grow. It's yet another 
awesome incentive to do weight training, but of course, it doesn't last. After 
a while, to really effectively continue to add muscle mass or burn off fat, 
you need to gear your diet towards one or the other. 

### So how long do I need to do this for? 

Well... forever. Or, at least as long as you want to have control over your 
body weight. A diet cannot be a temporary thing, because if you go back to 
your old eating habits, you'll undoubtedly also go back to your old 
weight.Worse yet, the more weight you lose, the harder it gets. For one thing, 
as your bodyweight gets lower, your basal metabolic rate drops as well. This 
means you burn less calories per day, so to maintain a caloric deficit, you 
have to eat even less (or exercise more). For a small amount of weight loss, 
this effect will be minimal, but if you're losing 20lbs or more, you'll need 
to take it into account&mdash;the calorie tracking websites I mentioned actually 
do this automatically for you. This is yet another reason 
maintaining/adding muscle mass is so beneficial for weight loss: for the same 
amount of mass, muscles take more calories to maintain, which means merely 
having them lets you burn more calories. 

But don't worry, it's actually not that hard. After a few weeks, it becomes a 
part of your life and does not feel like a chore. Moreover, seeing results is 
an unbelievable motivation. Losing weight will make a significant daily impact 
in your life. Everything from getting up from the couch, to running up a 
flight of stairs, to how you perform at sports and exercise will improve. 
You'll boost your energy levels and your confidence. Of course, depending on 
how much weight you lose, your old clothes might not fit you any more, but I 
think you'll get over it. Also, when you finally reach your target weight and 
switch from a daily caloric deficit to eating maintenance calories, you'll 
find that you can feel totally stuffed every single meal and not gain an 
ounce. 

### Do I have to do Crossfit like you did to lose weight? 

No, not at all. In fact, my first Crossfit workout was on July 7, by which 
point I had already lost 23lbs. Before that, my only real exercise was some 
weight training 3 times a week using the [Bill Starr 5x5 
routine](http://www.geocities.com/elitemadcow1/5x5_Program/Linear_5x5.htm). 
The main role of exercise in my weight loss was as a way to help maintain LBM 
and to increase how many calories I burned per day. Exercise has many other 
benefits as well, but it's definitely not a requirement for weight loss. You 
could just eat less to get to a caloric deficit and I guarantee that you'll 
lose weight. 

### How do I eat so much protein? 

The typical daily recommendation is around 1.0 grams of protein per pound of 
body weight. This is a pretty hefty amount, but it definitely goes a long way 
towards helping maintain LBM. Of course, not everyone needs that much: if you 
don't do any exercise or are very heavy to begin with (over 300lbs), you can 
probably do just fine with closer to 0.5 grams of protein per pound of body 
weight. In any case, if you need to up your protein intake, you'll probably 
need to rework your diet around foods that are high in protein, but relatively 
low in calories. One gram of pure protein has about 4 calories in it. For any 
given food, you can divide the number of calories it has by the grams of 
protein. The closer this number is to 4 (which is the theoretical minimum), 
the "cleaner" a source of protein it is - that is, you can eat more of it to 
up your protein intake without increasing your caloric intake too much. Below 
is a list I've compiled of high protein foods and their calorie to protein 
ratio. Foods closer to the top give you a better protein "bang for the buck". 
These numbers are from [thedailyplate.com](http://www.thedailyplate.com/) and
