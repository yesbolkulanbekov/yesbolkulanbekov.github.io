When I started the [30 day blog fitness 
challenge](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2011/07/07/30-day-blog-fitness-challenge/), 
I promised I would cheat. Today, I deliver on that promise. This post is less 
of a blog entry and more of a tumblr-style micro-blog. 

Below is a video you should watch. It's the kind of video that would make the 
world a better place, if only enough people saw it. Turn it on, sit back and 
enjoy the deeply moving prose of the one and only, Carl Sagan.
