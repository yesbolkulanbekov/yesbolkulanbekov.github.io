I recently moved to a new apartment and had to buy a whole bunch of furniture, 
including a bed frame, bookshelf, dresser, and couch. I had to do the move in 
a bit of a hurry, so I did one rapid fire furniture shopping session at 
[Ikea](http://www.ikea.com/), taking advantage of their shipping policy: $59 
for delivery within 30 miles regardless of how many items you bought and 
same-day delivery if you order by 2pm. 

I had this grand vision of ordering furniture Friday morning and relaxing in 
it Friday night. Not being a seasoned furniture shopper, I forgot one very 
important detail: all Ikea furniture requires assembly. And lots of it.

It's not exactly hard, but it takes a lot of time and requires you to have the 
patience to read and understand Ikea's *word-less *manuals. That's right, the 
instructions don't include a single word: they are entirely composed of images 
and symbols, presumably to save on translation costs.

Taking a page from the lego instruction manuals, the folks at Ikea generally 
do a pretty good job of visually conveying each step. Having said that, the 
graphics&mdash;especially the "best practices" images at the beginning of each 
instruction pamphlet&mdash;can be fairly amusing.

And occasionally, some of the images are downright incomprehensible. So, for 
those of you who've spent some quality time with "Billy", "Ektorp", and a hex 
wrench, here is some entertainment:
