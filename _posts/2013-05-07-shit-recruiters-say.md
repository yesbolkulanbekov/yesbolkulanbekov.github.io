Just today, I got my 1,000th recruiter email in the last ~4 years. I know this 
is the number because I'm slightly [obsessed with 
organization](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2011/07/23/obsessed-with-lists-how-i-organize-my/) 
and have added a specific label to each and every recruiter email I've gotten 
in my gmail account. Let's see: 365 days per year, minus 104 weekend days and, 
say, 10 vacation days, gives us roughly 250 working days per year. 

That means that, on average, 1 recruiter emails me every single business day. 

There are a few take aways from this: 

1. Being a software engineer is awesome. We don't apply to jobs, they apply to 
   us. 
1. If you are a recruiter, you're up against some serious competition. 
1. I've seen recruiter emails from every tech company you can think of. Some 
   are comically bad. 

In this blog post, I'm going to share snippets from a few of the bad ones. 
Enjoy!

Wow, that escalated quickly.

Yes, this email literally said &lt;name&gt;. Umm, no thanks &lt;company&gt;.
