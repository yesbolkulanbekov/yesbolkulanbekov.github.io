Every startup begins with an idea. This is a talk I did as part of
[NerdWallet's NerdTalks Series](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/corporate-news/nerdwallets-speaker-series-nerdtalks/)
that discusses how to come up with startup ideas and validation techniques you
can use to pick the ideas worth working on.
