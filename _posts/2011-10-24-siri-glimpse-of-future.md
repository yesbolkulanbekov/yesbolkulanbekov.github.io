Last week, I picked up an [iPhone 4s](http://www.apple.com/iphone/) and got a chance to try out 
its premiere feature, [Siri](http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/siri.html). 
Siri is a digital assistant that lets you talk *to* your phone to get things 
done. You can turn the phone on, bring it up to your ear, and ask Siri for 
driving directions, to add reminders, find restaurants, play music, schedule 
meetings and more. 

When I first heard about this, [like many 
others](http://mashable.com/2011/10/14/siri-iphone-love/), I wasn't impressed. 
Why would I want to *talk* to a phone? The UI on an iPhone is efficient and, 
as a techie, I'm pretty good at using it. Even though we've seen it predicted 
in all sorts of Sci-Fi movies, from [Scotty in Star 
Trek](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hShY6xZWVGE) to [Dr. Bowman in 2001: A 
Space Odyssey](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkyUMmNl4hk), I was still not 
sure why talking would be preferable over other interfaces. 

After using Siri for a week, I get it. Siri is a glimpse of the future. 

In this post, I'll tell you why that's a very good thing. 

## It's not voice recognition 

First, let's get something out of the way: Siri is not just voice recognition. 
Voice recognition by itself is nothing new and has been available for a while, 
even on phones. The important thing to understand is that voice recognition is 
merely the first step of what Siri does. It's what happens *after* your voice 
has been transcribed that's new and exciting. 

Siri does a remarkably good job of *natural language processing*. In other 
words, it actually tries to understand human speech. 

Before Siri, almost all voice recognition systems only worked if you used a 
very specific set of keywords and phrases&mdash;incantations, really. With Siri, 
you can speak more or less naturally and it (she?) does a remarkable job of 
understanding you. You don't need to read a manual or cheat sheet to use Siri: 
just start talking and you'd be amazed at how it seems to *just work*. It's 
certainly [Clarke's third 
law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke's_three_laws) at play, but at times, 
Siri seems truly magical. 

## Context 

Not only does Siri understand normal human speech, it's also aware of the 
context around the conversation. For example, Siri is aware of both your 
location and where you live, so you can say: 

> Remind me to water the plants when I get home

As you pull into your driveway, the reminder will go off. Or, you can try:

> Do I need an umbrella this weekend?

And Siri will check the forecast in your area, see that it's 70 and sunny, and 
say "no". Siri also remembers the previous things you've said, so you can have 
a whole conversation with your phone: 

> * What pizza places are around here?
> * I found a number of pizza restaurants fairly close to you. *(a list 
>   comes up with Yelp reviews)* 
> * What about burgers?
> * I found 20 burger restaurants fairly close to you. *(another list from 
>   Yelp)* 
> * What's the best one?
> * I found 20 burger restaurants fairly close to you. I've sorted them by 
>   rating.

Natural language processing + context + apps = some amazing possibilities that 
go far beyond the "voice recognition" you've seen before. 

## Efficiency 

At first, I thought Siri would only be useful when my hands are busy, such as 
while driving and never expected to talk to my phone otherwise. As it turns 
out, talking to Siri can be a huge time saver in all situations. For example, 
imagine I want to set an alarm that will go off at 9am every weekday. Here are 
my two options: 

### Option 1: touchscreen UI 

1. Push the power button 
1. Slide to unlock 
1. Swipe through app screens to the clock app and tap to open it 
1. Tap the alarms tab 
1. Click the plus (+) to create a new alarm 
1. Use the spinners to set the time to 9am 
1. Tap the repeat menu 
1. Tap each of the weekdays individually 
1. Tap save 
1. Done. 

### Option 2: Siri

1. Push the power button 
1. Hold the phone up to my ear and say "wake me up at 9am every weekday" 
1. Done. 

We're talking an order of magnitude faster. Similar time savings can be 
observed when getting directions ("how do I get home?"), scheduling meetings 
("setup a meeting with Jon for 9am tomorrow about mobile strategy") and many 
other tasks. The ability to skip dozens of menus and huge amounts of text 
entry is a huge boost in efficiency. 

And here's the kicker: the iPhone touchscreen UI is built *incredibly* well. 
It's arguably one of the most intuitive and efficient UI's available. Despite 
that, it's still orders of magnitude slower than Siri. 

## Accessibility 

Speed and efficiency are great, but *accessibility* is why Siri is truly a 
glimpse of the future.  Although the iPhone touchscreen UI is intuitive and 
beautiful, it's still something that must be explored, experimented with, and 
learned. I'm a "power user", so I find it easy; the average person, even with 
a best-of-class interface, will find it harder. 

The beauty of Siri is that it makes all of the functionality of a high tech 
smartphone available to *everyone*. Even the least tech savvy person knows how 
to talk, give commands, and ask questions. As Siri progresses, the bar for 
using the state-of-the-art will get lower and lower. 

And after all, wasn't that always Steve Jobs' goal? Wasn't he always striving 
towards technology that was accessible to anyone, with no training and no 
confusion? Siri is a small step in that direction: pick up your phone and, in 
plain English, tell it what you want. 

## Personality

Finally, Siri has a personality. She can even be a bit cheeky.

There's an entire site dedicated to [Siri's clever 
responses](http://shitthatsirisays.tumblr.com/). But these are more than just 
easter eggs. They bring Siri - and your iPhone - to life. The iPhone has 
always done spectacularly well in terms of [customer 
satisfaction](http://www.redmondpie.com/iphone-ranks-1-on-customer-satisfaction-charts-study-reveals/); 
giving the phone a personality will make people *love it*. Siri will become 
assistant, friend, and even a part of you - [we are 
cyborgs](http://www.ted.com/talks/amber_case_we_are_all_cyborgs_now.html), 
after all. I suspect that after Siri, you'll never be able to go back to a 
phone without it. 

## Just the beginning 

Now, let's not get ahead of ourselves. Siri is just the very first step. 
Actually, that's not entirely accurate: Siri is yet *another* step in a long 
continuum of making computers ever more accessible. From punch cards, to the 
command line, to the mouse &amp; keyboard, to touch screens, and now, natural 
language processing. There is still a great deal of work to do, but give Siri 
a try now to see where things are headed. 

In the near future, I expect Siri to be integrated with countless more apps. 
For example, I'd love to see Shazaam ("what song is this?"), New York Times 
("what's happening in the world?"), shopping apps ("is this a good deal?"), 
and social networking apps ("who is this guy?"). I wouldn't be surprised to 
see some element of "learning" added as well, allowing Siri to become more 
personalized by using more info about you and your contacts (e.g. via 
Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn integration), getting better with accents and 
mannerisms of speaking, remembering previous conversations you've had and... 
who knows what else.
