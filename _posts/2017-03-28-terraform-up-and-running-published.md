Today, I'm happy to announce that *[Terraform: Up & Running]({{ site.terraform_up_and_running_url }}?ref=ybrikman-blog-published)* 
has been published! 

{% capture url_with_ref %}{{ site.terraform_up_and_running_url }}?ref=ybrikman-blog-published{% endcapture %}
{% include figure.html path=page.thumbnail_path alt="Terraform: Up & Running" url=url_with_ref %}

On the front cover, you'll find a flying dragon lizard (*Draco volans*), a small reptile so named for its ability to 
glide using winglike flaps of skin known as patagia:
