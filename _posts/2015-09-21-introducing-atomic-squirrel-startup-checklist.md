**Update**: Atomic Squirrel has merged with Phoenix DevOps into a new company called
[Gruntwork](https://www.gruntwork.io/?ref=ybrikman-introducing-atomic-squirrel)! Check out the [Introducing
Gruntwork](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2016/04/25/introducing-gruntwork-up-and-running-aws-2-weeks/) blog post for
more info!

For the last several months, I've been working on a new project: my own company.
It's called Atomic Squirrel and our goal is to help you launch your startup.

Launching a startup is a long, complicated, and confusing process. Most
startups hire an experienced lawyer who they can call every time they have a
legal question. Now you can hire an experienced startup team who you can call
every time you have a product, technology, or team question. You can think of
Atomic Squirrel as a "<strong>co-founder as a service</strong>."

We have helped many companies with product design, marketing strategy,
data-driven development, system architecture, infrastructure development,
coding practices, production deployment, scalability, research, recruiting,
training, and much more. So no matter what your startup is struggling with, we
can fill in the gaps. The best way to find those gaps is to try out our
Startup Checklist:

<div>
  <a href="{{ page.checklist_url }}" class="block mb2 center mx-auto bg-checklist no-underline">
    <h2 class="pt6 px1 white caps">The Startup Checklist</h2>
    <h4 class="px3 white caps regular">160+ tasks required to launch a startup</h4>
  </a>
</div>

This is a list of everything you need to do to launch a startup. After using it
for years to successfully launch a variety of projects, we're excited to share
it with all of you. Every time you launch something new, consult this list to
make sure you didn't forget any important steps. Did you set up Google
Analytics? Is your website showing up in search results? Are you tracking
business expenses correctly? Did you set up social media accounts and a mailing
list? Is your database backed up regularly?

We hope you find this list useful for launching your startup. The list doesn't
go into much detail on each task, so for a deeper look, check out the book
<a href="{{ page.hello_startup_url }}">Hello, Startup: A Programmer's Guide to Building Products, Technologies, and Teams</a>.
If you need help with any of the items, or just need feedback and advice, you
can submit your list to Atomic Squirrel, and we'll set up a
<strong>free 30 minute call</strong> to discuss your startup.
