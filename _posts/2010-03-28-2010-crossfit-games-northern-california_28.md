After a smooth [first day of competition](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2010/03/28/2010-crossfit-games-northern-california/), 
Sunday was a bit of a mess. Although all of Saturday's scores and standings were 
[available online](http://scores2010.crossfit.com/scoring/north-california/), 
no one really knew who was eliminated, who would compete on Sunday, when to 
show up or when the workouts were. Not until ~11PM on Saturday did a link to a 
[heat schedule](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://crossfitoakland.com/sites/default/files/Sunday_Heats.pdf)
appear on the [Crossfit Games website](http://games2010.crossfit.com/) in the 
*comments* of the day 1 results page. The schedule looked legit&mdash;there 
were timings for the top 186 finishers from Saturday (the other 70 were 
cut)&mdash;but the whole thing looked poorly planned out.

My workout wasn't scheduled until noon, but I felt bad for those who had their 
first heats at 8am. The disorder continued when we arrived around 10:30 and 
found out that everything was massively delayed and my workout had been pushed 
back to 1:20. I would've expected these sorts of details to have been worked 
out more smoothly considering registration for the qualifier was $100. 

Anyways, after baking in the sun for 3 hours, it was time for [the two back-to-back Sunday 
workouts](http://games2010.crossfit.com/blog/2010/03/norcal-sectional-sunday-workout-and-scaling-option/):

## Workout C1

> In 6 minutes, work up to a max squat clean to overhead. 
> 
> * The bar must start on the ground, you must pass through a squat, and then 
> send the bar overhead in any manner you choose. 
> * You'll be able to designate your opening weight before the workout begins, 
> and the judge will be able to help you load and unload weights. In addition, 
> you'll have plenty of time to warm-up prior to the beginning of your 
> heat.

Weight completed: 235lbs (missed 245lbs twice)  
Rank: [61](http://scores2010.crossfit.com/scoring/r/355/) (out of 174 competitors)

Once again, Crossfit honed in on another weakness of mine: the split jerk. I 
could get the bar to my shoulders without difficulty - the cleans were no 
where near my max - but I just could not get more than 235lbs over my head. I 
missed the jerk on 245lbs twice, both times with horrendous technique. I'll 
definitely be practicing this lift a lot more in the future.

## Workout C2

> At the immediate conclusion of Workout C1, perform the following for time: 
> 
> 25 Burpees  
> 100-yard Walking Lunge  
> 
> Then 5 Rounds of:  
> 
> * 15 Dumbbell Shoulder-to-Overhead (40lbs) 
> * 100-yard Dumbbell Farmers Walk (40lbs) 
> 
> Then: 
>
> 25 Burpees  
> Row 500m  
> Run 450 yards

Time: 21:25  
Rank: [101](http://scores2010.crossfit.com/scoring/r/356/) (out of 173 competitors)

A brutal workout&mdash;especially on the shoulder/traps from the combo of 
farmers walk and shoulder press&mdash;but overall, a pretty classic Crossfit 
"chipper." 

## Final Thoughts

{% include figure.html path="blog/crossfit-games-qualifier/me-dead.jpg" alt="After the qualifier was over" %}

I ended the weekend in [61st place out of 256+ competitors](http://scores2010.crossfit.com/scoring/p/98/).
As a software engineer who spends ~10 hours a day behind a desk, I'm pretty 
happy with a finish in the top 25%. To qualify for the regionals, I would've 
needed to finish in the top ~8%, but I had too many holes in my fitness. The 
good news is that I had one hell of a fun weekend: the athletes put up some 
amazing performances, the spectators were incredibly supportive, I learned a 
lot from the experience, and I know what I need to work on for next year.
