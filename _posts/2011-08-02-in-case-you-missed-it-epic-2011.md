A week ago, I listed [5 reasons why everyone should watch the Crossfit 
Games](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2011/07/24/5-reasons-everyone-should-watch/). 
I hope you listened, because what went down [July 29 - 31 in Carson, 
CA](http://games.crossfit.com/) was nothing short of spectacular. I was 
catching glimpses and recaps even while I was [up all night at a 
hackday](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2011/07/31/up-all-night-linkedin-intern-hackday/) 
and watched all the final day's events live. I don't watch sports much these 
days&mdash;a topic for another blog post&mdash;but this was one of the best sporting 
events I've seen in a long time. If you missed it, here is a recap of some of 
my favorite moments. 

## Swimming, beach running

Crossfit is all about training for the "unknown and unknowable" and this year, 
they really meant it. Every kind of exercise was on the table. For the first 
time ever, we even got swimming. And not just any swimming, but *ocean 
*swimming in the very first workout. This [Beach 
Workout](http://games.crossfit.com/node/624508) also included running on 
soft sand, pull-ups, push-ups and squats. Not surprisingly, a Navy SEAL [came 
in first on this 
event](http://games.crossfit.com/features/individual-event-1-results). 

## Softball, gymnastics

The first day continued with a [skills 
test](http://games.crossfit.com/node/624520). This included an L sit hold for 
time, a handstand walk for distance and, my personal favorite, a softball 
throw for distance. In the past, Crossfit has taken flak for being too focused 
on pure work: how far can you run, how many reps can you crank out, how much 
weight can you lift. Testing these skill movements helps separate the true 
all-around athletes from the guys that are just workhorses. 

## Rope climbs, redemption

Day 1 concluded with a workout that included [rope climbing and 
cleans](http://games.crossfit.com/node/624524). This is standard fare for 
Crossfit, but if you watched the [Crossfit Games in 
2010](http://games2010.crossfit.com/), you may remember Rich Froning Jr. 
losing his grip on 1st place when he couldn't climb the ropes in [the final 
workout](http://media.crossfit.com/cf-video/Games2010_E6Men_FinalHeat_SD.mov). 
After a full year to work on this weakness, he came back this year and 
absolutely crushed the rope climbs at the end of day 1 for some beautiful 
redemption. 

## Monkey bars, biking

The variety continued on day 2 with the [Killer 
Kage](http://games.crossfit.com/node/624542) workout. This combined front 
squats, riding a watt bike (another first for the games) and a 100 foot monkey 
bar course. You don't often get to see full grown men racing each other across 
monkey bars, but believe me, the ending of [this 
video](http://games.crossfit.com/finals/live/jumbotron/629369) will have you 
on the edge of your seat. 

## Sled push, sled pull

The dog sled made a huge and unexpected presence in the final day of the 
Games. In the morning, the [Dog-Sled 
workout](http://games.crossfit.com/node/624546) required the athletes to push 
a ~450lb sled across the stadium. If seeing the Games' smallest male 
competitor, 150lb Chris Spealler, [take this beast 
on](http://games.crossfit.com/finals/live/jumbotron/629767) doesn't get you 
out of your seat, nothing will.

The [final workout of the day](http://games.crossfit.com/node/629757) 
concluded with the athletes picking up a rope and doing a sled pull. It 
provided a wonderfully visual way of knowing who was in the lead. Pat Barber 
got [the whole stadium to its 
feet](http://games.crossfit.com/finals/live/jumbotron/630016) when he managed 
to find just the right technique for it. 

## 2nd place 2010, 1st place 2011

There is something beautiful and poetic in the 2010 Crossfit Games runners up 
becoming the 2011 Crossfit Games champions. Congrats to  Rich Froning Jr. and 
Annie Thorisdottir, the two fittest people on the planet.
