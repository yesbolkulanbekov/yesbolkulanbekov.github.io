In part one of this series, I showed you weird [signs, billboards and 
writing](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2011/07/18/travel-quirks-part-1-signs-bilboards/). 
In part two, I showcased my [gastronomic 
adventures](https://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2011/07/19/travel-quirks-part-2-gastronomic/). 
Today, in the thrilling conclusion of my travel quirks series, I leave you 
with all the stuff that didn't fit into the previous two categories. You'll 
see some sculptures, some animals, some celebrity Doppelgängers, and a bunch of 
other stuff that made me laugh while traveling. 

## Sculpture

I think this statue 
is supposed to represent a heroic soldier calling people to arms, but, to be 
honest, the most heroic thing about it is holding that ridiculous pose. It 
took me a few tries to not fall over so we could get this priceless photo. I 
also prefer the local interpretation of the statue: a waiter chasing down a 
customer. "Sir! Wait! You forgot your jacket!" 

## Animals 

While sitting on the main square in 
[Krakow](https://picasaweb.google.com/brikis98/Krakow#), we saw a strange 
looking pigeon waddle up to us. As it came closer, we realized that there was 
a ring of bread stuck around its neck. I'm not sure how it got there, but the 
pigeon seemed to be unaware of it. In fact, the dumb bird spent most of its 
time wandering around and frantically searching and fighting for, uh, more 
bread. It would occasionally walk  up to other pigeons and make a face like 
"hey, seen any bread around  here?" The tragic irony, of course, is that if 
this bird is successful and eats enough to make itself fat... it'll suffocate.

## Doppelgänger

Does the man in the following image look familiar?

Uncanny, right? 

Let's try another one:

Coincidence? 

Ok, last one: 

{% include figure.html path="blog/travel-quirks/not-sauron.jpg" caption="Hotel Ibis, Nurnberg" %}

{% include figure.html path="blog/travel-quirks/sauron.jpg" caption="The eye of Sauron, Lord of the Rings" %}

How far Sauran has fallen: relegated to a hotel Ibis in Germany for all eternity. 

## Tetris 

When I moved across the country to California, I took advantage of  Virgin 
America's cheap baggage policy: $25 per bag, 50lbs per bag, up to 10 (!) bags. 
I had about 7 bags worth of stuff that I wanted to bring with me and taking it 
on the plane turned out to be far cheaper than shipping it or buying it new. 
There was just one issue: I flew in alone. As it turns out, lugging 7  bags 
through the airport by yourself can be a bit tricky. Fortunately, my Tetris 
skills came in handy.

## Faces

Humans have a remarkable ability for facial recognition. So remarkable, in 
fact, that we tend to see faces everywhere. There are [entire 
blogs](http://facesinplaces.blogspot.com/) dedicated to it.

## European cars

You'll rarely see an SUV, van or other big vehicle in Europe. They tend to 
stick to small cars. Really small.

## Toilets

You probably know that medieval castles often had huge, thick walls designed 
to keep enemies out. You may have even heard that they would rain down arrows 
and boiling hot oil on any invaders who dared approach. What you probably 
didn't known, however, is the other thing that would rain down castle walls. 
It turns out that they built outhouses - which were little more than a seat 
with a hole in it - high up on the *outside* of the castle walls. Talk about 
adding insult to injury. Funnier still is the fact that the doors to these 
outhouses would only have locks from *inside* the walls; apparently, some 
invaders were determined enough that they tried scaling the walls and breaking 
in through the outhouse.

## Happy travels! 

On that classy note, I conclude my travel quirks series. I wish you the best 
of luck on your own journeys, weird as they may be.
